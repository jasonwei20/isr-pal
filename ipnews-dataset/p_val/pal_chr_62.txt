 Abbas’ unforeseen announcement on August 27 that he, along with a few others, will resign from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee and his call for an emergency session of the Palestine National Council (PNC) is a testament to his poor management. More, it shows his utter disregard for the minimally-required threshold of responsible leadership. Abbas, like his predecessor Yasser Arafat, has used and discarded the PLO and its various, now near-defunct, institutions as his personal political playground: summoning PNC members to vote on pre-determined and decided agendas and to cast and re-cast roles within the PLO’s Executive Committee as a way to punish and reward. In addition, Abbas is in no position to criticize Hamas for its talks with Blair. It is particularly disingenuous that Abbas and his party are accusing Hamas of flouting Palestinian Unity and consensus, while both – Abbas and Fatah – have contributed to Palestine’s political afflictions more than any other leader or faction in the past. In fact, while Gaza subsisted and suffered terribly under a protracted Israeli siege and successive wars, Abbas operated his PA outfit in Ramallah with the full consent of the Israeli Government. The so-called ‘security coordination’, chiefly aimed at crushing Palestinian Resistance in the West Bank, continued unabated. “Our greatest high-tech geniuses working in the most sophisticated laboratories could not invent a more comfortable Palestinian partner. A leader with no one to the left of him in the Palestinian political arena and one who, when his enemy, Israel, bombs his people in Gaza, comes out with a statement criticizing those who kidnap Israeli soldiers.” Abbas has shown little compassion for Gaza. Neither has he demonstrated any respect for the Palestinian people nor has he invested sincere efforts aimed at making Palestinian unity his top priority. It is rather telling that he is activating the PNC, summoning its nearly 700 members, not to discuss the intensifying Palestinian crises – from Gaza to Jerusalem to Yarmouk – but rather to concoct another cozy arrangement for him and his cronies. Yet, this crisis of leadership precedes Abbas. The PNC’s first meeting was held in Jerusalem in 1964. Since then and for years now, despite the Parliament’s many flaws, it serves an important mission. It was a platform for Palestinian political dialogue; and, over the years, it helped define Palestinian national identity and priorities. But gradually, starting with Arafat’s elections as the head of the PLO in February 1969, the PNC ceased being a Parliament, and became, more or less, a political rubber stamp that validated all decisions made by Arafat’s PLO and, specifically, his Fatah faction. This has been highlighted repeatedly throughout history with several prominent examples: On November 12, 1988 the PNC convened in Algiers to approve of a political strategy based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338, the habitual US condition for engaging the PLO. At the end of deliberation and, based on that approval, Arafat announced an independent Palestinian State, to be established in the Occupied Territories, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Despite this, the US still argued that the PNC statement did not qualify for an ‘unconditional’ acceptance of Resolution 242, hence pressing Arafat for more concessions. Arafat flew to Geneva and addressed the UN General Assembly on December 13, 1988, since the US refused to grant him an entry visa to speak at the UN Headquarters in New York. He labored to be even more specific. However, the US maintained its position, compelling Arafat, on the next day, to reiterate the same previous statements, this time, explicitly renouncing “all forms of terrorism, including individual, group or state terrorism.” But unlike Arafat’s misuse of democracy and manipulation of the PNC – which is no longer representative or, with its current factional makeup is, frankly, irrelevant – Abbas’ game is even more dangerous. Arafat used the Council to ratify or push his own agenda, which he mistakenly deemed suitable for Palestinian interests. Abbas’ agenda, however, is entirely personal, entirely elitist and entirely corrupt. Worse, it comes at a time when Palestinian unity is not just a matter of smart strategy, but is critical in the face of the conceivable collapse of the entire Palestinian national project. UN: Gaza Could be ‘Uninhabitable’ by 2020 Abbas Has ‘No Intention’ of Standing in Coming PLO Election Brilliant and thoroughly accurate analysis of the present political crisis in Palestine. It sheds light on the urgent need for a new stage in the Palestinian people’s struggle for freedom from not only physical bur also psychological occupation that they have been suffering for over seven decades now. The first step to liberation is to rid oneself of the enemy within. As a Latin American I know of the hard task and struggle for achieving a genuine democracy in the framework of occupation and persecution by our own rulers in connivance with the oppressors. I hold great hope for the destiny of the brave Palestinians. Long live Palestine. So may times I have mused on writing an article soley  concerned  with the question of ‘corruption’ within the so called corridors of power in the PNA.Today,  the very word corruption sits comfortably as the public has become over familiar with corrupt practices all over the world. Ramzy Baroud  uses it but does not  appear concerned with referencing the evidence?Where is it,what form does it take,who will substantiate it? In the absence of the latter it  just stays with the status of rumour! Palestinians leaders and businessmen must be very happy that nothing changes.
