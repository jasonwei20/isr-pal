 A Palestinian photojournalist was injured by Israeli forces on Friday afternoon, as dozens others suffered from tear gas inhalation during the weekly protest in the occupied West bank village of Kafr Qaddum. Popular resistance coordinator in Kafr Qaddum, Murad Shtewei, told Ma’an that Israeli forces “assaulted” participants in the protest minutes after it began. Photojournalist Nidal Shtayyah was hit by Israeli soldiers with a tear gas canister in the back of his head. He was taken to Rafidia hospital for treatment. Shtewei added that Israeli forces fired a barrage of tear gas, which landed mostly in surrounding homes, causing participants in the protest, as well five members of a family to suffer from tear gas inhalation. Residents of Kafr Qaddum began staging weekly protests in 2011 against land confiscations, as well as the closure of the village’s southern road by Israeli forces. The road, which has been closed for 13 years, is the main route to the nearby city of Nablus, the nearest economic center.
