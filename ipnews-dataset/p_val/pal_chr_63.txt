 Over 1,000 Israeli, Arab, and foreign activists have held a peace rally in Tel Aviv, calling for "liberty and justice for Gaza" and the lifting of the Israeli-imposed blockade on the Gaza Strip.  To mark the first anniversary of the first Israeli bombs that fell on the Gaza Strip on December 27, 2008, the demonstrators marched in central Tel Aviv on Saturday and chanted slogans condemning the blockade of Gaza.  The 22-day Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip killed over 1,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured over 5,500 people.  In anniversary events that began earlier this week, demonstrators accused the Israeli government of committing war crimes in the territory.  One Jewish pacifist participating in the demonstration said, "We pray for a speedy, total and peaceful dismantlement of the state of Israel, the villains against the victims of Gaza and Palestine. Our hearts cry, our hearts embrace the people of Palestine."  On Thursday, hundreds of people, including international activists, held a similar protest on both sides of the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.  Israel imposed the blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas came to power in the territory in June 2007.  The Iron Wall of Egypt Saudi FM: Israel Spoilt Child of Intl. Lenience
