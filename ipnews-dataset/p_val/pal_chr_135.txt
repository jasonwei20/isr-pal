 The Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas) says that the Egyptian soldier shot dead during the recent skirmishes in Rafah border crossing was not killed by Palestinian fire.  According to the Palestinian Information Center, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri on Tuesday expressed the movement’s astonishment at claims by Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit that Egypt had the names of two Palestinians who shot the Egyptian soldier during clashes that broke out at the Palestinian-Egyptian border.  Abu Zuhri emphasized that accusations by Egypt are intended to cover up the responsibly of its soldiers for firing at Palestinian citizens. The Hamas official explained that the Egyptian soldier was killed by a friendly fire that targeted Palestinian youths.  Egyptian forces shot and wounded dozens of Palestinians last Wednesday during a violent protest on the Egypt-Gaza border against an underground steel wall that Egypt is building to block supply tunnels into the Gaza Strip.  The shooting erupted after scores of Palestinian protesters hurled rocks at the soldiers, witnesses and medical officials said.  Egyptian state television claimed that gunfire from the Gaza Strip had killed an Egyptian border guard.  Egypt, which has come under growing criticism by Arab and Muslim groups, has been collaborating with the Israelis in its 28-month blockade of the impoverished coastal sliver of Gaza.
