 A new report by an Israeli NGO has warned that the Gaza Strip’s infrastructure is on the verge of collapse and time is running out. Gisha also “parcels out the responsibilities of all relevant actors and shares expert opinions for immediate solutions that could stave off collapse and promote reconstruction and development.” The NGO notes how, “even in the best of circumstances, Gaza residents receive continuous supply of electricity for no more than eight hours per day, water is undrinkable, untreated sewage flows to the sea, and Gaza’s cellular communications are stuck several generations behind.” ‘Hand on the Switch’ outlines how responsibility for the current situation is divided among the actors involved – Israel, the authorities in Ramallah and in Gaza, Egypt and the international community. “One fact stands out above all”, Gisha states, namely that “Israel has maintained 50 years of continuous control over Gaza.” Decades of Israel’s physical presence inside Gaza (1967-2005) “created a near complete dependency on it for the supply of energy, water and communications.” Gaza’s infrastructure was not developed according to the needs of a growing population, “and as a result, Gaza was left behind.” According to Gisha, “Israel has taken advantage of Gaza’s dependency on Israel for political purposes, including at times by stopping supply of fuel and electricity. It also prevents Gaza residents from accessing advanced communications technology.” The NGO also notes the “severe restrictions Israel has imposed on access to and from Gaza over the past two decades, and especially since 2007 when the closure on the Strip was tightened, destroyed the economy and thwarted maintenance and development of infrastructure.” Happy Holidays from Gisha. Israeli restrictions on the entrance of so-called ‘dual-use’ items, “obstruct efforts to repair infrastructure, such as the power plant and its fuel reservoirs, which were damaged in air raids, and delay the development of alternative energy sources, as well as water and sanitation projects.” Gisha is calling on Israel “to allow the entry of materials needed for repairs and maintenance and to facilitate, instead of hamper, the work of other parties involved, Palestinian as well as international”, in what it calls a “legal and moral duty to ensure normal lives for Gaza’s civilian population.” Gisha also urges “the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas government, Egypt and the international community to work together to ensure Gaza residents have access to the dignified living conditions they deserve.” (MEMO, PC, Social Media) At Ramallah Event, Facebook Official Denies Agreement with Israel Gaza Must Stay at the Helm: Extending the Displacement of Palestinian Civilians Hamas spends about 1/2 billion a year for its budget of which 100 million goes to the military. Why?  Who is going to invade them?   How much do they spend on infrastructure?   Your problems are due entirely to that idiot in the mirror I am Reyaz from Sri Lanka. When are the Hamas and Israel going to realize they need to work together for peace? Development has to start from education. And since this is a region full of conflict we should spend more time developing the healthcare industry first. When can we start? In addition the historical site important to Muslims and Jews should not be hindered in this process- It is vital that the future generations get along without learning to hate each other.
