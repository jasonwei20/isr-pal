dermer blasts narrative of a peaceful palestine concern that obama will support paris initiative new york israels ambassador to the united states slammed on sunday the fiction that a partner for peace exists within the palestinian authority warning of a hostile reaction from jerusalem to any effort to impose terms of a two state solution through international bodies addressing the jerusalem post conference in new york ambassador to the us ron dermer a close confidant to prime minister benjamin netanyahu said world powers supporting an initiative by france to outline parameters for peace between israel and the palestinians are ignoring the will of the free people who live in the most endangered democracy on earth these powers albeit with the best of intentions will only encourage the palestinians to continue their 100 year campaign to destroy the one and only jewish state dermer told the crowd such an effort will not only prevent peace today he said but could prevent peace for decades to come and bolster international efforts to delegitimize israel in a separate speech at the conference ed royce chairman of the house foreign affairs committee expressed concern sunday that the obama administration is preparing to support an initiative at the united nations on the middle east peace process royce r california said he does not believe that parameters for peace outlined at the united nations an initiative led by the french government would include a demand for security for the jewish state previous administrations have opposed action at the united nations as an imposed effort upon the two parties to the conflict counterproductive to the pursuit of a negotiated peace settlement both likely us presidential candidates republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton oppose the approach my concern is that the administration might allow this french initiative to go forward royce said dermer one of netanyahus most articulate advocates repeated a theme common in his speeches that the decades old conflict between israel and the palestinians is largely misunderstood he rejected the narrative paradigm that israel is an occupying force avoiding peace negotiations seeking to ethnically cleanse arabs from historic palestine and insidiously constructing settlements toward that end on the contrary he argued the conflict took root long before the construction of a settlement bloc and that six of israels past prime ministers have offered generous peace terms to palestinian leadership to no avail the conflict predates the building of settlements by at least 50 years he said dermer warned that world powers supporting frances initiative would unwittingly enable palestinian leadership to continue avoiding genuine negotiations at least two resolutions related to the decades old conflict are currently under the pen one being spearheaded by france and the other by the palestinian authority the palestinian draft would have the security council state its opposition to israels settlement activity in the west bank a position held by each individual permanent member of the council the paris led initiative would have the security council outline parameters of a two state solution israel fervently opposes both efforts the white house said last year it was willing to review its policy toward the conflict in the united nations and it has yet to explicitly rule out such an approach but with congress power of the purse royce said that negotiations over a new decade long us defense package to israel would be sure to include sufficient security assistance including robust missile defense and a guarantee of israels continued qualitative military edge over its neighbors for years to come royce noted his willingness to reconsider us aid to the palestinians if it continues what he characterized as its incitement to violence against israeli jews we really have to have leaders in this world that rather than pushing incitement are having a genuine dialogue he said in a criticism of pa president mahmoud abbas we have to have the american public understand the challenge here dermer turning to discuss iran slammed the narrative that iran is divided between moderates and extremists and that a nuclear deal reached with the country last year will empower its better angels in a world of fiction iran will become a partner of the us in its fight against islamic extremism he said mockingly in a world of fiction a richer iran will curb its aggression end its support for terrorism and yet he argued that since the joint comprehensive plan of action was implemented the opposite has proven true irans regime continues to suppress its own people at home hanging gays and stifling speech and has according to dermer expanded its network of proxy militias around the world despite being the most maligned country on earth israel is the most remarkable country on earth dermer added because israel he said is not a fiction it is a real country with real people
