liberman slams swedish prime minister for vowing to recognize palestine foreign ministry to issue protest to stockholm via ambassador in tel aviv plo applauds move foreign minister avigdor liberman on saturday night slammed the swedish governments intention to recognize the state of palestine and the foreign ministry announced it will summon swedens ambassador to protest the move swedens recently elected prime minister stefan lofven said friday during his inaugural address in parliament that his government will recognize palestine a move that would make it the first major european country to take the step the conflict between israel and palestine can only be solved with a two state solution negotiated in accordance with international law lofven said during his address in comments diplomatic sources in jerusalem said were meant to give his constituents what they wanted to hear a two state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to peaceful co existence sweden will therefore recognize the state of palestine he said liberman issued a statement saying that rather than dealing with israel and the palestinians during his inaugural speech it would have been better for the swedish premier to focus on more urgent matters in the middle east such as the daily mass murders in syria iraq and other countries in the region lofven is the head of a center left government that has come to power following general elections in september if israel had a tough time with the swedish government under its previous government which was center right lofvens statement is an indication that the relationship will now likely be even more difficult the former swedish government refused to recognize palestine as the palestinians did not control the territory they claimed for statehood diplomatic sources said they are not fearful that lofven would begin a snowball affect in europe as the leader of a rather precarious center left government is unlikely to set the standard for the rest of europe the social democrats and greens hold a minority of seats in parliament and the incoming center left government is likely to be one of swedens weakest for decades within the eu some countries such as hungary poland and slovakia recognize palestine but they did so before joining the 28 member bloc if the center left government fulfills its plans sweden would be the first country to recognize palestine while being a member of the european union the eus stated position is that an independent palestinian state should only emerge through a negotiated process the plo on saturday welcomed swedens announcement the swedish announcement is in fact a sign of a genuine commitment to justice and the requirements for peace including the two state solution on the 1967 boundaries said plo executive committee member hanan ashrawi we hope that other countries in europe will follow swedens lead those who claim to support the two state solution must realize that in order to reach it whats missing is a sovereign palestinian state she said according to the plo 138 countries recognize palestine as a state including brazil south africa chile russia the holy see argentina india and china but it has failed to gain major recognition in the west with the european union and the us preferring the conflict resolved through negotiation conditioning recognition of the state of palestine on the outcome of negotiations with israel is equivalent to making our right to self determination an israeli prerogative this fails to address the very basis of the values upon which the united nations was founded including its responsibility to protect and act accordingly ashrawi said
