jerusalem slams spanish parliament for calling on madrid government to recognize palestine compromise ensures declaration accounts for legitimate worries interests and aspirations of israel the foreign ministry put out a caustic statement on wednesday saying that rather than voting on tuesday to recognize a palestinian state the spanish parliament would have been much better off had it condemned the palestinian terrorist attack on a jerusalem synagogue earlier in the day the ministry was responding to a decision by the lower house of spains parliament that overwhelmingly passed a nonbinding motion calling on madrid to recognize palestine as a state this move which took place on the same day as the har nof attack followed similar motions passed recently in british and irish parliaments the spanish parliaments declaration only pushes away further the chances of reaching an agreement between israel and the palestinians because it encourages the palestinians to take extreme positions the foreign ministry said it would have been better had the spanish parliament seen fit to denounce the abominable massacre in a jerusalem synagogue carried out by palestinians who were incited spanish ambassador fernando carderera soler in an israel radio interview acknowledged that the timing of the vote came at a very bad moment but he said a terrorist attack is a terrorist attack it cannot affect your life and life has to go on and so it is also with the parliament the ambassador took issue with the foreign ministry statement saying the motions text was balanced and very positive for all parties including israel it doesnt worsen the situation and this is not what the spanish parliamentarians want to do the spanish parliamentarians want to provide an incentive for negotiations he said asked how madrid would respond were the knesset to pass a resolution backing basque or catalonian independence the ambassador said the knesset would have no ground whatsoever to get involved in those issues not historically legally politically or economically following tuesdays vote spanish foreign minister jos garc a margallo expressed satisfaction that all political parties have decided to vote for this declaration he added that just as spanish politicians must arrive at accords in the parliament so too we have to arrive at accords in the european union if we want a foreign policy thats common and truly continental the position of the spanish government has been to seek recognition of palestinian statehood as the end result of bilateral negotiations rather than unilaterally recognizing it outside such a process margallo said monday before the vote that the worst service we can give to the cause of peace in the middle east is for each country to continue advancing national isolated solutions and not a joint solution the bills main proponent former spanish foreign minster trinidad jim nez opened tuesdays legislative session by restating her conviction that the solution to the conflict in the middle east depends on the coexistence of two states she said because negotiations have been cut off again and again it is necessary to take another step forward towards palestinian statehood and regional peace its not against israel and its not against palestine she said monday in an interview with the jerusalem post its only to push parties to negotiate to sit down spains congress of deputies passed the motion after the largest opposition party the spanish socialist workers party led by jim nez rejected an amendment from other opposition groups to fix a time line for the recognition of palestine spanish newspaper el pa s reported but the more significant compromise was between the opposition and the ruling popular party which added a paragraph promoting an international solution to the israeli palestinian conflict that takes fully into account the legitimate worries interests and aspirations of the state of israel the newspaper reported the motion passed with 319 votes in favor two opposed and a single abstention the motion is set apart from the ones taken in the irish and british parliaments by stipulating that spains recognition of a palestinian state must be the result of talks between israel and the palestinians that stipulation emerged from negotiations between the popular party which insisted on it and socialist workers party whose original draft motion on recognizing a palestinian state made no mention of such a condition another poignant change to the original draft was the dropping of the word contiguous from a line that describes the future palestinian state as a sovereign democratic and independent state behind the scenes acom a small lobbying group that supports israel and is run from madrid by jews and non jews was working around the clock to convince the popular party to insist on the changes to the original motion some in the opposition took positions during tuesdays session that went further than the resolution basque politician rafael larreina took the podium wearing a red white and green scarf that said palestine in english he condemned the recent violence in israel including a terrorist attack that killed five in jerusalem and the hanging death of a palestinian bus driver that israel police ruled a suicide saying those events lead to the conclusion that its urgent to recognize a palestinian state addressing a gallery of diplomats from the arab world communist politician joan josep nuet said israel invades palestinian land and kills its people and called for the urgent recognition of a palestinian state with a capital that is called jerusalem referring to the french parliaments november 28 vote on palestinian statehood he said the news tomorrow will be that we urge the government of spain to recognize the state of palestine like sweden has done as well just like france will do next week and how other european countries will possibly do following our example
