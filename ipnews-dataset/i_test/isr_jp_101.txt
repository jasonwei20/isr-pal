allow syrians to settle in palestine as citizens not refugees the unraveling of syria and the mass exodus of many of its citizens provides israel with a historic diplomatic opportunity to realign the palestinian refugee issue with humanitarian and economic rather than political and ideological concerns palestinian authority president and fatah leader mahmoud abbas recently called on israel to allow palestinian refugees in syria to be resettled in areas under palestinian control israel would be wise to grant this request with one important stipulation that those palestinian refugees who are relocated to the palestinian territories be granted full palestinian citizenship relinquish their refugee status and thus their claim to return to israel predictably abbas would refuse this caveat as until now the arab world has held the palestinians right of return to be more important than humanitarian concerns the very fact that the pa maintains refugee camps of palestinians in what they themselves call palestine is testament to this fact however given the fact that current refugee crisis has literally landed on europes doorstep the international community will likely pressure abbas to give in to israels reasonable demand how could it be that syrian refugees resettled in germany are granted full rights as german citizens but syrian refugees resettled in what many in europe recognize as palestine continue to be considered refugees indeed europe continues to pays tens of millions of dollars a year to provide welfare to palestinians living as refugees within the pa controlled areas in doing so giving in to a political demand rather than practical humanitarian and economic considerations if europeans handled the palestinian refugee issue with the same consideration as the current refugee crisis facing europe by permanently resettling refugees outside of their displaced homes and eventually giving them economic independence it would give new hope to resolving the arab israeli conflict those in israel who fantasize that the west bank will somehow someday be part of israel will of course be against any measure that would deliberately increase the proportion of non jews living there their concerns and desires however are as impractical as the palestinians desire to return to their ancestors land in israel and should be dismissed as such israel for its part should welcome a token amount of refugees into israel as a gesture of goodwill and neighborliness in hopes perhaps naively of improving the poisoned relations with arab citizens throughout the region and strengthening israels diplomatic standing among its own allies the author worked in the knesset as a foreign policy adviser and holds a masters degree in diplomacy and conflict resolution from the interdisciplinary center herzliya
