when only the critics are heard highlight that there is so much focus on the holy land is a fact of life the trouble is that the narrative of israel and its history is being communicated to the english speaking world almost entirely by those who dislike it terra incognita the writer is a phd researcher at hebrew university and a fellow at the jerusalem institute for market studies among the themes that top the list of the coming years publications dealing with the middle east are iranian history lebanons vibrancy saudi arabia and stories of american combat soldiers but there is one that unsurprisingly towers above all the rest israel and the palestinians of the 700 books that will be published in english on the middle east in the next year 107 15 percent of them will be devoted to the conflict or aspects of it this is based on a careful examination of forthcoming publications at amazon com although there are probably other obscure publications lurking out there that there is so much focus on the holy land is a fact of life but the trouble with the forthcoming publications is that the narrative of israel and its history is being communicated to the english speaking world almost entirely by those who dislike it lone defenders like alan dershowitz and reasoned supporters like martin van creveld and martin gilbert are among the authors of next years harvest dershowitz is the author of a novel about israel trials of zion not a nonfiction account for the israel bashers that dominate publications on the region gaza is a favorite topic nine books are in the pipeline for that small sliver of land james patras a retired professor from binghamton university and author of numerous books on the israel lobby has just published war crimes in gaza and the zionist fifth column in america in gaza beneath the bombs an international solidarity movement volunteer and another radical left colleague write about gazans facing oppression not only with courage but with humor four books being published will be adorned with the unoriginal separation fence on the cover to be fair one is merely the paperback version of columbia university prof rashid khalidis the iron cage the story of the palestinian struggle for statehood pappe is publishing two books using the fence as a motif the first peoples apart israel south africa and the apartheid question claims that for the first time one of israels most celebrated academics ilan pappe has gathered together perspectives on whether israel is an apartheid state the conclusion wont be surprising pappe already claimed israel committed ethnic cleansing in 1948 one wonders what original allegation will come next pappe and jamil hilal a sociologist at bir zeit university are also publishing across the wall narratives of israeli palestinian history jeff halper an american born activist in the israel committee against house demolitions uses a photo of the wall on the cover of the second edition of his an israeli in palestine resisting dispossession redeeming israel the mufti haj amin el husseini and the nazis get some attention klaus gensicke a german scholar covers the topic in his the mufti of jerusalem and the nazis and three authors collaborate on a volume examining nazi palestine the plans for the extermination of the jews of palestine pappe again examines the rise and fall of a palestinian dynasty the husaynis he follows in the footsteps of his fellow israeli historian living in the uk avi shlaim author of lion of jordan the life of king hussein in casting arab politicians as remarkable figures the two state solution gets short shrift in the coming year with hasan afif el hasans is the two state solution already dead and virginia tilleys paperback edition of the one state solution a breakthrough the palestinians get doting coverage by academics and authors who genuinely appreciate them hillel cohen an excellent israeli writer publishes on the rise and fall of arab jerusalem amal jamal examines arab minority nationalism in israel and rochelle davis assistant professor of anthropology at georgetown university researches palestinian village histories azzam tamimi a london based scholar offers a sympathetic analysis in hamas a history from within basam raad attempts to reconstruct an indigenous history of palestine in his hidden histories nicolas rowe an australian expert on dance who lives in ramallah gives us a cultural history of dance among the palestinians books on the jews in israel hardly compare in their sympathy in his personal search for the soul of a nation nbc tel aviv bureau chief martin fletcher has written walking israel but he incongruously uses a photo of an arab village probably taiba and minaret on the cover one wonders if he would have put a church on the cover of a book about egypt tudor parfitt and emanuela trevis semi edit the jews of ethiopia the birth of an elite which includes essays calling the mass deaths of ethiopian jews in sudan a myth and claims europeans may have created an ethiopian jewish identity thus the palestinians get a genuine narrative from academics but even the ethiopian jews cannot mourn their dead without being denigrated the history of israel has been left almost entirely to those who hate it while the palestinians have conquered both the academy and the intellectual world with stories of their suffering narratives and history even hamas and haj amin both of whom borrowed from nazi rhetoric are considered sympathetic anyone visiting israels leading bookstore steimatzky will find the israel section crowded with shlomo sands the invention of the jewish people and yitzhak laors the myths of liberal zionism they will be hard pressed to find anything positive about the country it is a commentary not only on the publishing world both academic and popular but also on israels cultural elites who show little interest in writing positive things about their country it is a remarkable testament to the moral bankruptcy of the west which finds so little positive in israel but can be open to the most conservative chauvinisms of palestine unless we struggle to change the narrative our history will soon be left to our critics
