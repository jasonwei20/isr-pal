israel vows to arrest palestinians who embraced arafat in jordan after palestinian negotiators in the middle east peace talks publicly embraced yasir arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization israel said today that they would be arrested as soon as they returned to this country a staged kiss and hug session between the negotiators and mr arafat held thursday in the jordanian capital amman both infuriated the governing likud party and stuck it with an embarrassing dilemma as israelis prepare for a national election on tuesday to arrest the palestinians who include leaders from east jerusalem and the occupied west bank and gaza strip could risk unraveling the peace process on the other hand to do nothing would invite opposition charges of weakness and perhaps ignite internal likud protests that the government had abandoned its insistence that the p l o be excluded from the negotiations tough talk and delay action so the official strategy today was to talk tough but to avoid action until the palestinians come home which may not happen until after the election immediately on their return to israel they will be arrested and all the necessary steps will be taken against them said police minister ronni milo a close ally of prime minister yitzhak shamir in separate comments the prime minister denounced these provocations and said without elaboration that legal measures will be taken in amman one of the affected palestinians hanan ashrawi called israel s position ridiculous and said she would defy it mrs ashrawi who lives in the west bank city of ramallah said according to reuters it is my right to go back to my home insomuch as it is our right to speak to our leadership and to live freely and not under occupation other targets of mr milo s warning include faisal al husseini the dominant palestinian figure in east jerusalem and dr haider abdel shafi of gaza chief palestinian delegate to the peace talks the opposition labor party accused likud of sticking its head in the sand and said the dispute shows that the shamir government despite its protestations has indeed been negotiating directly with the p l o all along the people who met with mr arafat in jordan represent residents of the occupied territories and would be acceptable negotiating partners to a labor led government the party said in a statement a 1986 israeli law forbids contact with the p l o and other groups judged to be terrorist organizations and israelis have been jailed for breaking it including the best known peace campaigner abie nathan but since the start of peace negotiations last fall and presumably at least partly in response to united states pressure the government has avoided any boat rocking reaction to apparent violations by mr husseini mrs ashrawi and others in recent months the palestinians have become more open about their p l o contacts still after each incident senior officials said they had no hard evidence of any law breaking and rejected criticism from the israeli far right that they were endangering national interests the events on thursday however made it impossible for the shamir government to continue turning a blind eye with reporters and photographers invited to record the session mr arafat hugged and kissed peace talk delegates who had journeyed to amman where he is recovering from recent surgery to remove a cerebral blood clot mrs ashrawi lay her head on the p l o chairman s chest although mrs ashrawi insisted that the meeting was not timed with the israeli election in mind palestinians in east jerusalem said that there nonetheless seemed to be an attempt to embarrass mr shamir and also to make clear that any post election government here will in fact be negotiating with the p l o perhaps even more important some said was the message from mr arafat that he remained in charge despite his illness and unhappiness with him among many palestinians in the territories in addition the amman session was widely seen as an attempt by mr husseini and the others to bolster their own leadership which has been somewhat tarnished on the street by the absence of tangible progress in the peace talks
