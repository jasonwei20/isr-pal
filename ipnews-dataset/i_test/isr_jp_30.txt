the five state solution at long last even if years too late israelis woke up this week to the realization that we face yet another existential threat yes it took 100 000 men in black in downtown jerusalem to make the point but finally we get it as dangerous as are the delegitimization of israel and the specter of a nuclear iran israel is no less threatened by a growing population of religious fundamentalists who insist on the right to racial discrimination in their schools and who utterly reject the legitimacy and authority of the supreme court they reject in other words the idea of a jewish and democratic state theres more of course including their treatment of sephardim even haredi sephardim the often despicable attitude to women in their communities their tendency toward violence when irked they attack city workers police officers and even the haredi rabbi who urged the sephardi parents to go to the supreme court and most obvious their unwillingness to share the burden of defending this country this cancer threatens to destroy everything we have built yes thats a harsh metaphor but its apt as dan ben david of the taub center has shown despite its current economic stability the state of israel is simply economically unsustainable if matters continue this way barring a dramatic shift in policy the country will collapse under the weight of these haredi cells that drain the energy from the best of the body theres nothing inherently evil about a cancer cell we dread it only because it kills the organism we desperately wish to preserve haredim have every right to live as they wish but that does not mean that we must allow them to destroy the country that we have built at such great cost over the past century the hand wringing of the past week suggests that most israelis believe that theres little we can do i disagree with apologies to jonathan swift i offer the following modest proposal for our collective consideration those who argue that the two state solution will not work are right we need not a two state solution but a five state solution 1 hamastan will be created on the territory now known as the gaza strip and will be ruled by the same people who already run it like iran and north korea hamastan will survive through sheer force and the use of terror until its citizens rebel its borders are already internationally recognized it already has a flag and international sympathy in abundance yes its short on many other commodities so one presumes that even as israel continues to blockade it for it will remain sworn on israels destruction it will have to continue to let in massive humanitarian aid either by sea or by land but perhaps egypt will open its borders and let goods flow in from the south after all its not as if hamastan will be sworn on egypts destruction in hamastan in short nothing but the name changes 2 fatahland on the other hand will rise from what is today the west bank or judea and samaria it too thankfully already has a flag it could become a democracy though probably a limping one at best considering the palestinians record of creating transparent democratic institutions true we might be pleasantly surprised and its democracy might flourish equally possible though is that absent israels efforts at propping up the scaffolding of its democratically inclined leaders fatahland could slip into dictatorship the jury is out but whether fatahland is democratic or just another version of the brutal regime of hamastan would really not be israels problem fortunately even if fatahland begins as a despotic regime however that could eventually change for as americans like john adams and his compatriots knew as millions of former soviet citizens learned and zionists before may 1948 understood well you can earn freedom when you want it badly enough and are willing to risk and sometimes to die for it perhaps fatahlandians will really crave freedom enough to be willing to die for it theyve proven that there are those of them willing to die to kill us now wed see if theyre willing to die to make themselves free palestine would probably be democratic it would simply be liberated from the oppressive jewish regime that it cant bear and would be free to chart its own course and amazingly israel might have a neighboring arab state with which its never been at war alas palestine does not have a flag the pas flag will be taken by fatahland and israels flag based as it is on the image of a tallit would be thoroughly unacceptable designing a flag will thus be one of the first challenges to which the leaders of the new state will have to turn their attention 4 haredia will be the ultra orthodox state based primarily in the jerusalem neighborhoods of mea shearim geula and sanhedria along with bnei brak and perhaps a few other localities haredia would be the country that last weeks 100 000 plus protesters clearly desire it would have a supreme council of rabbinic elders not the vile secular supreme court that so offends them they would be free to do whatever they wished with their schools and with their sephardim they could impose a halachicly based system of law as other countries have done with sharia they could virtually guarantee the exclusion of all the nefarious influences they so deeply object to in contemporary israel they could impose whatever standards for conversion they wished without causing a rift with the rest of the jewish world which would actually have more in common with turkey than it will with haredia todays haredim already have a political party called degel hatorah the flag of torah surely theyll have some ideas for a flag how haredia will defend itself against attacks from elements emanating from hamastan and fatahland is admittedly not entirely clear defense after all takes some serious commitment a willingness to risk and lots of training there is a real possibility unfortunately that haredia will be utterly unable to defend itself and haredians some will just call them haredim probably will find themselves the most abandoned and vulnerable group in the middle east what will the world say about that will there be the same outpouring of concern that there is now for the palestinians of gaza well learn a lot about the world from watching how many other countries come to the verbal and physical defense of haredia facing its arab neighbors all alone 5 israel will be the regions jewish and democratic state it doesnt have recognized borders but at least it does have a flag it will be mostly jewish though some israeli arabs will decide to remain israelis instead of becoming palestinians and they should be welcomed the same with haredim a few might be willing to recognize the legitimacy of the supreme court and might decide to live in a zionist entity if they want to go to the army and are willing to live off their own salaries and not off government subsidies then they too should be welcomed israel will be a broad tent it will include religious and secular right wing and left wing free marketers and those more inclined to socialism it will be home to im tirtzu a right of center student organization seeking to restore zionism to israeli campuses that countenances no criticism of israel whatsoever and breaking the silence former idf soldiers and other peaceniks whove now glommed on to them who travel across the world telling anyone wholl listen about the excesses of israeli power it will be home to avigdor lieberman and naomi chazan eventually of course its likely that both palestine and haredia will discover that running a country is a pretty complicated business you need hospitals and police you need a functioning court system you need people who can run the power company and the phones people who can fly airplanes and people who can represent you in the international community and theyll discover all that money that reform and conservative jews helped steer toward israel actually did make life much better so the time may come that theyll crawl back to us on their hands and knees begging us to annex them back imagine that israel annexes territory but because the territory actually asked to be annexed what a breath of fresh air wait though not so quick maybe well take them maybe we wont because by then hopefully well have had a serious national conversation about what our country is committed to we wont be embarrassed by the idea of a jewish democratic state and well have discussed what preserving it will entail so well tell them who we are they can join the enterprise called zionism or at least live with it and respect it or they can stay independent but we ought not to be cavalier about this scenario it is profoundly sad for israel too most israelis take great pride in the countrys commitment to diversity even if it is far from perfectly implemented its commitment to heterogeneity and to freedom is both one of its great strengths and one of its great weaknesses breaking up the region into these disparate countries addresses the weakness but also robs israel of potential strength its an eventuality israel should want to avoid what makes israel different from these other imagined countries is that it does not wish to purge from its ranks those who are different but it is slowly being given no choice the challenge to its leaders now were they only able to extricate themselves from their inability to make any decisions about anything at all is to take sufficient steps to show these populations that in an ideal world we want to live with them but even more than that we want to survive therefore if surviving means living without them so be it the real onus is on those groups who refuse to accept the notion of israel as a jewish and democratic state to show israelis how we survive with them and to demonstrate that their continued participation in our nation will not lead to its ultimate demise
