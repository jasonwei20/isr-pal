filmmaker shines a light on unsung diaspora warriors of 1948 the idea of fighting and survival has always fascinated us canadian producer and cinematographer jeff hoffman as a child he used to pick the brain of his uncle an auschwitz survivor about the holocaust particularly about why some jews fought and others did not he attributes the inspiration for his latest film four million bullets the untold fight for survival to his grandfather leo quint of newton massachusetts my grandpa was a zionist he tells the jerusalem post magazine over the phone from his home in marblehead massachusetts quint an upholstery shop owner used to travel to israel in the states early years and would donate gmc work trucks to kibbutz beit zera which converted them into ambulances quint filmed many of his travels enabling his grandson to delve into his ancestors past thus the seed of a story was planted in hoffmans mind one that swiftly blossomed with his discovery of the ayalon institute an underground bullet factory in rehovot used by the hagana between 1945 and 1948 under the guise of a kibbutz laundry today the once clandestine facility stands as a proud tribute to the 45 young men and women who produced more than four million bullets there right under the nose of the british this could be an incredibly interesting story hoffman thought to himself a real life story that he believed could make james bond pale in comparison hoffman set out to transform the ayalon institutes tribute into something more far reaching and globally accessible in the body of a film this set in motion extensive research into the events that led to the second wave of aliya and those who responded to david ben gurion and golda meirs appeals to us jews in the 1940s to help rally manpower funds airplanes ships and weapons for the jewish cause in palestine with fire in his eyes the former hollywood filmmaker reached out to people all over the world primarily canadian american and south

israel in the interwar period politicians experts academics and witnesses who all have unbelievable stories to tell some of which have never been heard before despite the existence of several films on these topics our film has evolved into an incredible on camera history series involving surviving members of the 4 000 international jewish and gentile volunteer soldiers along with the jewish financiers who funded under penalty of prison and death the airplanes ships and guns smuggled from all over the world to help fight for independence when the arab nations were prepared to sweep the jews into the sea the director states after the horrors of world war ii there was no second chance they had to win or die interviewee ann bussel of miami beach florida holds one piece of the vast

south africa who served as chief of air operations in israels war of independence was another subject of the film featured in the trailer simon who today lives in herzliya describes the beginning stages of the fledgling israel defense forces the spirit was all about the people of the time and today we dont find that same spirit hoffman says nostalgically they all said there was no alternative there was no other place to go only palestine was the jewish homeland if not for the heroic and innovative cooperation between the jews of palestine and the international volunteers before during and after battle the state of israel might not have survived past her first month says hoffman with quarter of the film left to complete he stresses that many eyewitnesses have died and time is not on our side increasing the urgency to complete the editing after which he intends to get the film out to a multitude of educational jewish organizations worldwide he is also in the process of raising additional funds to allow the continuation of the project hoffman mentions regretfully that two of his interviewees have already died since he and ahronheim began interviewing its a tribute to these heroes and heroines of israel and it would be great for them to be acknowledged while theyre still alive he emphasizes
