obama commends israeli author interviewers are frequently curious about what people in the public eye are reading and what theyre recommending unlike prime minister benjamin netanyahu who suggested that people should become more familiar with the bible president barack obama when asked in an interview with fareed zakaria on cnn which of the books that he had read during his summer vacation he would recommend mentioned two one of which was fiction colson whiteheads the underground railroad and the other sapiens a brief history of humankind by israeli author yuval noah harari in recommending the book it was obvious that obama had given it plenty of thought and was choosing his words carefully the slick delivery which usually comes across when hes making a speech was absent and his grasping for the correct expressions to describe the book was almost palpable the interview can be seen online for those who prefer to read his comments in print this is what he said its a sweeping history of the human race from 40 000 feet and part of what makes it so interesting and provocative is because its such a condensed sweeping history it talks about some core things that have allowed us to build this extraordinary civilization that we take for granted but werent a given it gives you a sense of perspective on how briefly weve been on this earth how short a time things like agriculture and science have been around and why it makes sense for us to not take them for granted it goes back to keeping the long view in mind in the sweep of history we get a very small moment in time sometimes one gets the feeling that israel is becoming a province of china as major israeli enterprises are being bought out by chinese investors and collaborative projects are being jointly undertaken by israeli and chinese universities tel aviv university which has close links with more than 30 leading chinese universities and cities has a particularly close relationship with tsinghua university in beijing and the morningside group which was established in 1986 by the chan family tau president joseph klafter was in beijing last week to participate in the launch of what is expected to be an annual china israel innovation forum the by invitation only event brought together some of the most influential israeli and chinese figures from academia government and industry who congregated at the beijing hong kong jockey club clubhouse to explore the latest in technological developments and university driven innovations klafter co chaired the meeting together with prof qiu yong president of tsinghua university and ronnie chan co founder of morningside and chairman of hang lung properties the china israel innovation forum reflects the mission of leading universities like tel aviv and tsinghua to be global forces for higher education and technological advancement said klafter adding this forum is literally about improving the world through the power of partnership and collaboration we can take life changing innovations from the lab to the marketplace and bring university discoveries to the general public after years of fruitful collaboration with tel aviv university the forum takes our partnership to a higher level said qiu tsinghua has always endeavored to cultivate innovative talent capable of tackling global challenges by bringing together the leaders of china and israels private public and academic sectors in the same place for the first time ever this forum will help turn promise into possibility and ideas into reality the keynote address at the forum was delivered by former israel ambassador to the united nations dan gillerman its human nature when coming to a strange place to look for a familiar face thus when education minister naftali bennett arrived at the wizo nir haemek school that is sponsored by wizo argentina and wizo usa he looked around to see if there was anyone he knew his face lit up when he saw world wizo president esther mor whom he had previously met at a meeting of the world jewish congress that was held in buenos aires in march of this year in addition to performing his official duties in ushering in the new school year bennett took the opportunity to speak to mor on educational issues of mutual interest the school has different units including an agricultural unit bennett and his entourage evinced particular interest in what students were doing at the ivcher dairy farm australian foreign minister julie bishop not only packed a lot into a two day visit to israel and the palestinian territories but also found time for a run with her athletic representative in israel ambassador dave sharma both in jerusalem and tel aviv the elegant foreign minister who looks great even in her running gear left a very positive impression on people with whom she met she asked probing intelligent questions articulately explained australias positions on iran and the palestinian authority and made it very clear that australias enduring friendship with israel is something that will continue to be nurtured most of her discussions centered on innovation cooperation regional security and the middle east peace process president reuven rivlin was so admiring of her that after she left he predicted to his staff that she would one day be the prime minister of australia shes very sharp he said enthusiastically bishop managed to fit in meetings also with netanyahu whom she invited to be the first sitting prime minister of israel to visit australia defense minister avigdor liberman opposition leader isaac herzog mk and former foreign minister tzipi livni and yesh atid leader yair lapid bishop also managed to fit in the mandatory tour of yad vashem and a visit to australias innovation landing pad in tel aviv which helps ambitious australian entrepreneurs to make the right contacts in israels innovation industry she also met some australian entrepreneurs in various fields of innovation who at the landing pad had been pointed in the right direction during her visit to the palestinian territories she refrained from calling them occupied bishop met with prime minister rami hamdallah and economy minister abeer odeh as well as with australian awards alumni who have returned to the palestinian territories to use the skills and knowledge gained in australia on her return from ramallah bishop stopped off at the australian embassy for a cup of tea with embassy staff in typical australian laid back informality staff members took selfies of themselves with bishop and told her about their work at the embassy then it was off to lunch with herzog and livni coffee with lapid a stop at the australian landing pad and on to ben gurion airport en route to berlin bishop was accompanied by sharma throughout her meetings in israel in addition to the traditional duties of a diplomat ambassadors have now become the personal photographers of the dignitaries whom they accompany sharma was very busy using the camera in his cellphone while still on the subject of australia zionist federation president danny lamm who is a frequent visitor to israel usually comes for meetings of the world zionist organization and the jewish agency this time he and his wife rolene will be coming to marry off their son rafi who at age 39 has finally decided to tie the knot much to the relief of his family he will wed australian lawyer aliza shira labbe at the david citadel hotel on september 22 among guests coming from abroad will be the grooms 92 year old grandmother ilse lamm from australia and the brides 90 year old grandmother annette wolk from south africa the lamm family in general has a distinguished history of community service particularly with regard to zionist organizations that may account for the fact that so many of them relocated from australia to israel though danny lamm is a prominent zionist personality in australia the groom is by no means walking in his fathers shadow a personality in his own right rafi lamm is part owner and ceo of the very successful l1 capital group in melbourne he has made large contributions to local jewish causes including the lamm jewish library of australia mizrachi and leibler yavneh college he is the past chairman of young uia and currently serves on the board as a cabinet member of this organization he was recently appointed to the board of governors of ariel university hes not leaving it to the last minute to come to israel for the wedding he will be here two weeks ahead of time not to make final preparations but to lead an australian business delegation to israel to investigate investment opportunities in local hi tech companies but it wont be all business the bridegroom has also arranged for the delegation to visit various tourist sites around the country including historic locations in judea and samaria one of israels most crucial nonprofit exports is brainpower despite the fact that israel is the start up nation many hi tech scientists programmers engineers analysts designers testers researchers and operators are unable to find jobs in israel and are heading for silicon valley the israel consulate in san francisco estimates that some 50 000 israeli citizens are living in the san franciscos bay area and that more are likely to move there in the near future many of those who have already moved there have relatives friends and former colleagues who are engaged in similar professions and who are tired of trying to make ends meet in israel those who have already settled in the bay area and have found good jobs in silicon valley are envoys for the israeli brainpower exodus pao alto california based aya levkovitz a partner in ogen relocation notes that israels attitude has changed with regard to israelis living and working abroad their success in places like silicon valley often contributes to israels image in the world it also enables them to improve the quality of their own lives and those of their immediate families currently unpopular in haredi circles and not exactly a favorite with netanyahu transportation minister israel katz escaped being fired only because the prime minister was unable to muster sufficient support to get rid of his nemesis aside from the fact that katz had attempted to dilute some of the prime ministers power within the likud what probably irked netanyahu more last friday was the ministerial popularity poll taken by israel radios reshet bet in which katz came second after health minister yaacov litzman while netanyahu was second to last on the ladder katz who will celebrate his 61st birthday on september 21 has a lot of fans in the beit shean valley where veterans of the gilboa elementary school gathered to celebrate the revival of the train service which they used well over half a century ago to get to school katz revived the service which went out of operation 65 years ago katz declared that train rides on the line would be free during the three months running in period which will begin on the eve of succot and noted that the linking of the train service with places such as migdal haemek afula and beit shean would make the center of the country more speedily accessible to residents of these areas romance can be contagious as evidenced at the golden wedding celebration of prof alex deutsch and his wife gloria whose byline appears regularly in the jerusalem post magazine the couple who are still as lovey dovey as newlyweds despite having four adult children and numerous grandchildren celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a gala dinner dance at the dan accadia hotel in herzliya pituah where both the food and the service were superb hotel staff went out of their way to make this special event as pleasurably memorable as possible during the predinner reception the band played popular melodies of the 50s and 60s and older and continued to do so in the banquet hall the male singer did marvelous impersonations of the top singers of that era among the guests were brothers stephen and nick kopolof who had been page boys at the wedding in liverpool in 1966 stephen still lives in england and specially came to israel for the jubilee festivities a nonagenarian who had been at the wedding and now lives in ashkelon was simply referred to by everyone as velvel he also made it his business to be at the anniversary celebration prof deutsch is a specialist in colorectal proctologic service and nick kopolof in making a speech about the deutsch family spiced it with numerous witty references to the derriere pipeline deutsch is also the chairman of the israel britain and the commonwealth association which was well represented as was the south netanya ashkenazi congregation to which the deutches now belong having moved around a year ago from kfar saba to netanya also well represented were alex deutchs yachting companions all in all it was a very british affair when the first couples went out onto the dance floor they hesitated somewhat about getting nostalgic and embarking on ballroom dancing but as the occasion was a celebration of long lasting romance before long the dance floor was crowded with husbands and wives dancing in each others arms the way they did half a century ago and more almost every event of this kind has a movie with highlights from the lives of the couple concerned this one was completely different two of the four deutsch siblings rachel and tzvicka created an animated film in which the two characters bore a remarkable resemblance to their parents they changed the lyrics of strangers in the night to include a jewish component plus some judeo british humor and everyone laughed and loved it alex deutsch in a half jocular half serious tribute to his wife said that the first year of marriage was easy because he was interning and home only one night a week and one weekend in three he said that gloria had never made any demands of him and that hed never had to wash a cup gradually he realized that housework wouldnt kill him but why should i take a chance he asked with self deprecating humor he said that were it not for marriage he would go through life thinking that he had no flaws he credited gloria with bringing up the children because he had so many surgical emergencies to which he had to attend but noted that they had always shared their joys and sorrows together in love tolerance and forbearance the essential difference between this weeks celebration and the wedding he said was that this time he knew the guests from both sides an indication of the extent to which former president shimon peres is still considered to be newsworthy was the extensive coverage given to his having a cardiac pacemaker implanted this week he could have had it done earlier but the workaholic peres had to attend the ambrosetti forum in italy toward the end of last week and as he felt fine he saw no reason to cancel the ambrosetti forum which peres has attended for several years has since 1975 been an international economic forum held at the villa deste on the shores of lake como with the participation of heads of state ministers nobel laureates of which peres is one and business executives who discuss current challenges to world economies and societies diaspora contributors to israels development do not receive sufficient credit names of donors on building fronts and wall plaques are usually in english which means that only people who can read english bother to take note if at all yet almost every israeli institution and organization has a friends association or society in the united states as well as in several other countries among the institutions blessed by hefty donations from abroad is the hebrew university whose american friends have been supporting it financially for all of its 91 years american friends of the hebrew university was founded in 1925 by the american businessman and
