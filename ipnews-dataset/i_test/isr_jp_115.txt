the ball in the israeli court it seems that internal palestinian reconciliation might be on the road to success and that is not only good news for the palestinians but also for israel at no point has a majority of palestinian society supported the ideology on which hamas was founded and palestinian society while being conservative has never adopted an islamic fundamentalist ideology or agenda even today hamass ideology enjoys less than 15 support in gaza where it has ruled for a decade if palestinian reconciliation is successful and the palestinian authority retakes control of gaza it will be done with the participation of hamas and without the disarming of hamass militia the reconciliation process will be a direct result mostly of egyptian pressure which has for years let hamas know that the reopening of the rafah crossing between gaza and sinai would be contingent on hamas disassociating itself from the muslim brotherhood actively combating islamic state and other salafist groups extraditing terrorists wanted by egypt from gaza and allowing the pa to have the control over the rafah crossing from the gaza side this last point seems to have been facilitated by egypt creating some kind of role for the participation of pro muhammad dahlan forces in gaza noting that dahlan has significant support from the egyptian president and from the emirates this last point could also be the one on which the reconciliation deal falls due to the animosity that exists between dahlan and pa president mahmoud abbas if in the end reconciliation does occur the palestinian national council the sovereign representative body of palestinians in palestine and in the diaspora is likely to convene with hamas joining the ranks officially of the palestinian national movement and then elections taking place in the west bank and gaza for president and parliament creating an agreed to post abbas palestinian leadership new palestinian elections is what the overwhelming majority of palestinians want as it will put an end to the divided palestinian house and close the chapter on the 13 year term of a president elected for only four the palestinians are also likely to adopt a new strategy which may no longer be based on the two state formula which has been the official plo position since november 1988 if the palestinians do drop the two state formula they will do so in favor of the democracy option one person one vote for all people between the river and the sea this scenario has been spoken about for years and ive written about it many times this is not meant to be a threat but it should certainly be seen as one by anyone who believes in the basic zionist idea that israel is the democratic nation state of the jewish people if there is no two state option for partitioning the land of israel palestine into two nation states there is no non democratic jewish nation state option either in other words the removal of the two state solution possibility is the first step on a short road toward the end of zionism the two state solution is not simple and there are many risks involved in negotiating and implementing a negotiated agreement on partition with the palestinians but the dangers and risks for israel are compounded far beyond coming to terms with a palestinian state next to israel it is very unlikely that the current government of israel will open any genuine negotiations i have no illusions that there is currently an israeli partner for peace with the palestinians prime minister benjamin netanyahu and crew are leading israel directly to binationalism meaning a binational state with no equality and limited political rights for the palestinians who will make up more than 50 of the residents of that state in other words a new form of apartheid those of us who remain true zionists and are loyal to the idea and ideal of israel being a democratic nation state of the jewish people must stand up and declare that we demand that israel enter into negotiations with any palestinian leadership which accepts the two state solution even a palestinian government of reconciliation which include hamas the principle of accepting the zionist option of two states overrides the rejection of the idea of negotiating with hamas if hamas is willing to be at the table with israel then that is an implicit acceptance of the two state principle palestinian reconciliation that includes hamas will be accepted by the arab world by the west and probably even by the trump administration and will no longer serve as a convenient excuse for netanyahu and israel not entering into real negotiations with the declared outcome from the start of a two state solution but instead of pushing for a genuine peace process based on the principle of two states for two peoples netanyahu and his like are celebrating 50 years of settlement building and entrenchment of occupation making peace with the palestinians means putting a political border between the state of israel and the state of palestine and not expanding settlements on land which will have to be within the palestinian state the author is the founder and co chairman of ipcri israel palestine creative
