revisiting the peace process jordan israeli relations over the last year we have heard much about the possibility of a long and just peace between israel and palestine by contrast far from peace building the conversation surrounding the harrowing scenes we witness coming out of gaza and the west bank or recently out of jerusalem continues to focus on attributing blame to one side or the other the international complacency with the continued nonresolution regarding a palestinian state has generated widespread nihilism permeating zones of order and disorder it is a trigger for both zionist extremists who unsatisfied with palestine alone yearn for the penetration of the whole middle east and for islamist extremists who like isis are pursuing their own expansionist agendas when the balfour declaration of 1917 was incorporated into the preamble of the palestine mandate created with the authority of the league of nations the international community effectively violated the cardinal principle of self determination which was at the very core of the leagues covenant and subsequent charter the repercussions of this violation have been felt ever since above all in the cycles of violence in israel and palestine which continue to destabilize the entire region arabs and israelis have arrived at a crossroads either we move further away from one another pursuing self interests that will inevitably bring about destructive regional balkanization or we move closer together and taking our common humanity as the starting point realize a sustainable peace process founded on president woodrow wilsons guiding principle of self determination success will be predicated on dealing first with the obduracy of extremists whether the hardline israelis who insist on a god given right to the land roughly encompassing the whole of the southern levant or those who conversely are intent on drive ing the jews who live in their midst into the sea and who between them currently block any possibility of successful negotiations in the near future rather than reinvent the wheel a good starting point might be to reexamine the strengths and weaknesses of previous initiatives many of which were prematurely cast aside israels refusal to comply with the humanitarian responsibilities outlined in un security council resolution 237 1967 serves as a reminder that jordans sovereignty and territorial integrity should not be secondary to that of israel throughout jordans official involvement in the peace negotiations israelis regardless of party affiliation or ideological position maintained that jordan had no claim to the west bank the annexation of the west bank by jordan in 1950 they argued was recognized only by britain and pakistan and yet as i used to say to israels negotiator thats two more than recognized yours nevertheless the legal status of the territory remained unresolved a number of options by both sides that offered pragmatic compromises were all eventually discarded in favor of the camp david formula of gradual autonomy over a five year transition period moderates on all sides have been overpowered by those with extreme religious convictions and have been left to address the absorptive capacity of the land which we all inhabit these same extremists in their beliefs have ignored the vulnerability and fragility of this region whilst working towards our mutually assured destruction mad instead of being committed to our mutually assured survival mas the refugee problem along with the status of jerusalem as described in the jordan israel peace treaty is a trans boundary issue economic and social developments demand an integrated and agreed approach between the stakeholders the exploitation of natural resources and the growing demand for energy are all areas of critical imbalance which will be the root cause of future conflict minimum consensus which in itself is dangerous as it inevitably falls short of sustainable peace dictates that there can be no territorial compromise except in return for a conventional peace treaty this posits the following three questions first if two conventional peace treaties between egypt and israel and between jordan and israel have been inadequate to resolve the crises in the west bank and gaza how and when can we expect israel to initiate meaningful talks with the palestinians and its arab neighbors second if israel insists that jerusalem cannot be redivided and must remain the capital of israel what common ground is there between palestinians and israelis or between jews christians and muslims of arab cultures nationalist politics on all sides have poisoned the atmosphere between these peoples who lived happily together in the fertile crescent for centuries in his testimony before the anglo american committee of inquiry on palestine in 1946 chaim weizmann stated i wouldnt like to do any injustice the muslim world has treated the jews with considerable tolerance the ottoman empire received the jews with open arms when they were driven out of spain and the jews should never forget that on the other hand its no use blinking the fact that these great humanitarian traditions are now under the pressure of modern nationalisms the spiritual significance of jerusalem for judaism christianity and islam places it above regional geopolitics one way or another jerusalem must be shared once again among all the abrahamic faiths for there to be a peaceful region third how can comprehensive peace ever be achieved when no international conference such as the congress of berlin or vienna that involves all the superpowers or even key regional players is ever seriously considered given that the exclusionist policies of the security council are predicated on israeli exceptionalism and committed to shielding israels expansionist and discriminatory practices from illegal settlements to systematic abuses of civil rights comprehensive peace seems more obscure and elusive than ever this should be a major cause for concern we need a new regional architecture not unlike that of europe following the helsinki accords a constructive inclusive conversation not in competition with the west but recognizing the gravity of the situation in a spirit of mutual respect and partnership within this architecture any progress in the present conditions must be sought slowly gradually incrementally and organically and with an emphasis on the concrete issues of the conflict even while seemingly ceaseless time energy and news coverage is dedicated to the problem any suggestion today that we consider a process with a revised quartet that includes russia is greeted with apprehension and a marked lack of statesmanship yet such a process would strengthen those in israel who accept a jewish state within a more compact territory vis vis those who fearful of the arabs demand an ever larger israel it is perhaps stating the obvious to say that no number of fences or shields can provide long term security ultimately the conflict comes down to control over the region and its resources to ensure self determination for the arab people and nonexploitation of their resources the arabs must be involved in any peace process conversation so that their concerns and interests are heard as my friend the former turkish president turgut ozal god rest his soul told me once when there is a peace conference it is far better to be at the table than on the menu it is undeniable that the sense of separateness cultivated by israel and by those in washington who reward israeli belligerence admittedly aided by the intellectual intimidation practiced by militant islamist extremists prevents many in the arab world from seeing israel as a potential partner in regional development this situation is further exacerbated by zionists racist argument of carrying the white mans burden in palestine whereby israel inhabits the role of the civilizing white man in the region but the citizens of the world many arabs and israelis recognize this for the shameful colonial rhetoric that it truly is a unitary democratic state should be established in arabia where people irrespective of race and religion can work and live in harmony israel must acknowledge its own role as a stakeholder in regional stability and development by committing to peace along the lines laid down in un security council resolutions 242 and 338 furthermore jordan along with its neighbors must be included in talks and negotiations pertaining to the peace of our region only then can we move forward inclusively to address the possibility of the long and just peace we all so desperately seek hrh prince el hassan bin talal of jordan founded and is chairman of the west asia north africa
