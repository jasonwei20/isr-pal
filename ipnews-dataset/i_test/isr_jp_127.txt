cameron castigates miliband over mps vote on palestine london british premier david cameron launched a strong pre election attack on opposition leader ed miliband tuesday for forcing his labor party mps to vote for early recognition of a palestinian state in parliament two months ago addressing nearly 700 guests at the conservative friends of israels largest annual lunch which included several cabinet colleagues and many of his conservative partys 150 mps cameron noted there were just 142 days before the uks may 7 general election in a clear message to jewish voters he said labor in general and miliband in particular had shown their true colors on israel recalling the october house of commons vote on recognizing a state of palestine he noted that there had been a cross party consensus for many years that in effect stated we only recognize the state of palestine when there is a genuine two state solution and when israels future is truly secure yet miliband used a vote he could easily have avoided or walked away from not just breaking that consensus but actively whipping his own colleagues to support the motion he continued that is the labor leader we are now faced with and he has to be defeated cameron declared to loud applause he also noted that in local government the labor party governed two city councils where boycotts of israel recently featured in leicester last month the city council promoted a boycott of israeli goods while in the west london borough of brent in august labor supported the tricycle theater in banning a jewish film festival the conservative party leader drew further applause when he added unlike labor we in this party oppose boycotts and let me remind you of what i said to the knesset delegitimizing the state of israel is wrong it is abhorrent and together we will defeat it earlier cameron described himself as a friend of israel through thick and thin and praised israel as particularly extraordinary considering where it was on its doorstep the barbarism of isil islamic state the tyranny of syrian president bashar assad hamas and hezbollah a missiles distance away iran looming nearby with nuclear ambitions and terrorists all around hell bent on doing israel harm like those last month who brutally murdered four rabbis as they prayed he said the last referred to the attack on a synagogue in jerusalems har nof neighborhood nonetheless he expressed criticism of settlement building true friends will always try to offer you good advice and this is why i will always tell israel that illegal settlements are a bad idea he said he made clear that settlements did not advance the likelihood of peace or security for israel for which he said he knew its people were praying they make that aspiration less likely he said and when i went to jerusalem earlier this year my message to the knesset was this yes we will tell you when we think you are wrong but we will always defend your right to defend yourselves in reference to the summers conflict in gaza he observed that hamas had rained rockets on israel built extensive tunnels to kidnap and murder and repeatedly refused to accept cease fires as prime minister benjamin netanyahu said and i agree with this every word israel uses missile defense to protect its civilians hamas uses civilians to protect its missiles there can never be any equivalence between the two
