icc prosecutor un decision on palestine will have no affect on my rulings fatou bensouda tells post she will not be rushed into a war crimes probe of operation protective edge the hague the un general assembly does not dictate policy to the international criminal court office of the prosecutor despite its decision on the state of palestine issue top prosecutor fatou bensouda told the jerusalem post on monday in an exclusive interview with the fate of the idf and the countrys legitimacy at stake in the ongoing war crimes debate the post became the first israeli outlet to sit down for an in person interview with bensouda in her office on the courts permanent premises in the hague in the netherlands in operation protective edge some 2 100 palestinians were killed of them between 50 80 percent were civilians depending on whether one accepts the idf or un calculations the 54 year old gambian came out of the gates in her relationship with israel mostly under attack by prime minister benjamin netanyahu for recognizing palestine as a state in order for the icc to open a preliminary examination into whether israel and the palestinians have committed war crimes on monday bensouda who spent almost a decade as deputy chief prosecutor before taking the top job put those concerns to rest in one of the most intense exchanges of the interview that will be music to israels ears bensouda said the un general assembly does not tell me what to do that the prosecutor should act in this way or that way unless of course it is in accordance with the statute asked if this meant that the unga is now out of the picture of her legal conclusions bensouda in one of her rare emotional moments of the interview where she let down her guard said forcefully completely im not even thinking of why they would tell me why i should take this case and not this case that would be interfering with my independence but palestinians can take comfort in some of her other positions or non positions with bensouda like many legal officials observers are sometimes left grasping at non answers to shed light on issues which the official does not wish to discuss israel tends to lose most battles in the international arena with the exception being cases in which specific international figures are from the start ready to go against the grain and recognize the complex challenges it encounters in fighting its neighbors bensouda is not ready to declare her acceptance of israeli exceptionalism asked about whether the israeli case is unique because jerusalem would argue it has performed far more serious investigations of its own soldiers conduct during the gaza war than any prior country that the icc examined bensouda demurred from answering the question pressed about what her view is on israel and the palestinians situation after 18 months of preliminarily examining of the conflict she said i would not go to the extent of saying what is unique at this time elaborating she said we are not looking judging the whole judicial system of any state or any system that is supposed to have jurisdiction or that could exercise jurisdiction we are not looking at the judicial system and how it is functioning we are looking particularly at specific crimes and we are looking at specific conduct were looking at specific persons who bear responsibility for those crimes and what is being done with regard to that and as i always say we are doing this in an independent and very dispassionate way and this is very critical whether it is in any other situation over and over again she repeated the mantra of her commitment to the rome statute to her mandate and to being guided by a set criteria of the law applied by the icc with no accounting for exceptionalism even pressed on whether she would judge israel or hamas as more credible and truthful when the sides disagree about the specifics of an incident in which both could be on the hot seat she insisted she would not choose subsequently bensoudas office issued a clarification on this issue stating that she does not have any other criteria apart from those set by the rome statute and that is what will guide her assessment in the measured and remarkably consistent dispassionate tone that characterized most of the interview she stated that even if others viewed her non choice as a judgment its a judgment in the sense that i am going by my legal boundary if you are calling that a judgment yes that is a judgment because that is in the statute the top prosecutor said the message that i have consistently wanted to send i am not going to deviate from what the statute tells me to do i will not deviate from that not for any reason it is very critical for the credibility of this office i can assure you whether it is here whether it is palestine whether it is any other situation bensouda said emphasizing she would not be rushed i cannot sit here and say that it will take seven years or it will take 10 years or it will take any number of years all of this depends on the facts and the circumstances the preliminary examination cannot be given a timeline not that this should be confused with bensouda giving the idf extra slack her refusal to commit to a deadline for deciding whether to move to a full criminal investigation was due to an opposition in principle to making even theoretical commitments in fact she qualified that statement noting i will not hesitate to take the next step i will not hesitate once the legal requirements have been met to do what i have to do but it is not my situation that im sitting here waiting to pass it on to the next prosecutor because i dont have the courage or the mandate to make a determination see the jerusalem posts friday edition for our complete report from the
