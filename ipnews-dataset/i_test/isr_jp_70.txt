why israel may miss richard goldstone the legal universe transformed when the un made palestine a non member state the reaction of many to the un human rights councils decision last week to order an investigation as being a harbinger of goldstone 2 is understandable but many may not realize that they soon may miss goldstone 1 the goldstone report struck extraordinary fear into the israeli political defense and legal establishments because it was the first un report ever recommending criminal proceedings against individual israeli soldiers and policy makers as opposed to deriding israel as a country but at the end of the day the legal tsunami nightmare of dozens or more cases against israelis in the international criminal court never transpired but now we live in a different universe put succinctly the threat of criminal allegations against israelis going anywhere though there are many obstacles besides the statehood bar at the icc are far greater now than they were when the goldstone report came out next while there are many sound criticisms of goldstone he was the first un investigator to ever insist on adding to his mandate investigating and critiquing hamas of course most of the report was focused on israel in an unbalanced fashion but the fact that a large section focused on hamas gave israel some cover and muddled the anti israel message there is a good chance that the unhrc will make sure to appoint someone this time who will not investigate hamas or make it an even smaller part of the report finally while the unhrc undoubtedly had hoped that goldstones jewish credentials would be a fig leaf for the report goldstone himself ultimately repudiated much of his own reports findings and the interpretations that others gave to it this also hurt the reports power to pressure israel legally there is a very high chance that the unhrc will make sure not to appoint anyone who might have second thoughts over their criticism of israel this is not to say that goldstone will be forgiven by his many detractors but secretly some of those detractors may wish for a mere goldstone 1 once they get a look at goldstone 2
