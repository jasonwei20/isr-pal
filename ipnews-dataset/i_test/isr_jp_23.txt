israel palestine a new approach is needed what is the point of flogging a dead horse the israeli palestinian peace carriage has advanced not an inch in the 68 years since the founding of the state of israel its horse had no life in it from the very beginning ignoring the smoke screen of accusations and excuses thrown up by each side on each occasion the fundamental reason for the succession of failures is not difficult to deduce arab opinion as a whole resents the presence of the state of israel in the region palestinians regard israels declaration of independence in 1948 as a disaster and mark it annually with their own nakba day day of catastrophe mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority pa leads a fatah party whose charter states quite unequivocally that palestine with the boundaries that it had during the british mandate that is before the existence of israel is an indivisible territorial unit and is the homeland of the arab palestinian people each palestinian it declares must be prepared for the armed struggle and be ready to sacrifice both wealth and life to win back his homeland given the founding beliefs of abbass party this tactic inherited from his predecessor yasser arafat obviously represents only the first stage in a strategy ultimately designed to gain control of the whole of mandate palestine an objective explicit in what he says in the arabic media but which he never expresses in his statements to the world supporting the two state solution is designed to swing world opinion to the palestinian cause and it has succeeded very well but the naked truth is that no palestinian leader would ever sign up to it since to do so would be to concede that israel has an acknowledged and legitimate place within mandate palestine and that would instantly brand him a traitor to the palestinian cause no palestinian leader not arafat nor abbas nor anyone who might succeed abbas dares sign an agreement that recognizes israels right to exist within historic palestine it would probably be more than his life was worth from the palestinian perspective the insurmountable obstacle lodged within the two state solution is that one of the states must be israel the innumerable peace negotiations have at least yielded one inescapable truth short of committing hara kiri israel could never offer enough its very existence is anathema this is why the oft repeated cry of israeli leaders that only face to face negotiations can solve the interminable dispute is way off the mark face to face talks have been tried to destruction as far as reaching a negotiated peace is concerned the pa is a busted flush what is needed is an arab wide consensus reached with israel on the future geopolitical configuration of what was mandate palestine starting from the perhaps unpalatable but nonetheless undeniable presumption that israel is here to stay just suppose for one mad moment that israel simply pulled out of the west bank abandoned its towns and smaller settlements handed over east jerusalem as a palestinian capital and hey presto a sovereign palestine was born its fatah government would instantly be vulnerable to its greatest enemy bar none rejectionist extremist hamas the de facto government of gaza which has been at loggerheads with the pa for the past decade and which seeks to overthrow abbass administration in the west bank just as it succeeded in doing in gaza and not only hamas for the islamic state octopus seeking to control the middle east as a whole has already spread its tentacles into yemen and libya is too would soon be infiltrating a new weak arab state intent on absorbing it into its jihadist caliphate the arab world is well aware that a newly born palestine would be in urgent need of an effective military presence and high tech security on its borders as indeed jordan and egypt both are in serious discussion they would recognize that a resolution of the israeli palestinian conflict would require military cooperation across the board just as egypt liaises with israel in combating hamas and is in sinai and jordan in combating is across its borders with iraq and syria to create a sovereign palestine and leave its security to its own puny forces would be to throw the new state to the wolves that broader rapprochement has in effect been achieved forced into blossom in the hothouse created by the growing assertiveness of iran following its nuclear deal and the mayhem created in the middle east by the rampant islamic state albeit covertly israel collaborates on a broad range of security issues not only with egypt and jordan but with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates inter alia an arab israel conference at which the arab interest was represented by the arab league and which was charged with securing a settlement of the israeli palestinian dispute might well take as a starting point the arab peace initiative now 14 years old and adapt it to take account of todays realities a possible outcome of intensive but realistically based negotiation could be the creation of a new legal entity a confederation comprising three sovereign states israel jordan and a new born palestine conceived specifically to achieve close military and economic cooperation in order to guarantee the security of all three partners and their future growth and prosperity
