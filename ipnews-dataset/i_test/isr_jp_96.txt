the shape of pills its a powerful anti oxidant anti viral excellent for cardio vascular health and has been approved by the european food safety authority efsa paloleaf is just one of 38 factories that will be part of the jericho agro industrial park jaip a japanese funded joint israeli palestinian industrial park the goal is to increase palestinian exports israel will provide security as well as technical assistance and the goods will be shipped via jordan all over the middle east the park which has been 10 years in the making was inaugurated last week on a tract of land less than eight kilometers from the king hussein allenby bridge which connects the west bank and jordan japan has invested more than 300 million in the park and israeli has added 50m the un diplomats visited the area as part of a tour with project interchange an educational institute of the american jewish committee our purpose is to connect leaders and decision makers from all over the world with israel myra clark siegel the director of communications for project interchange told the media line we believe strongly in providing the opportunity for these leaders to see israel for themselves there is no substitute for first hand experience we want them to understand the complexity of israel and the region ajc has brought more than 6 000 people mostly diplomats journalists and university provosts to israel over the past 35 years this is the fifth time they have brought ambassadors most of whom had never visited israel before the ambassadors mostly from latin america and africa spent three days meeting israeli politicians and diplomats the fourth was the day in the west bank where in addition to the visit to jericho they went to ramallah the political and administrative capital of the west bank along the way they picked up a palestinian tour guide mohammed qasem who described the division of the west bank into three sections area a which is under complete palestinian control and makes up about 18 of the west bank area b which is under joint israeli and palestinian control and area c the 62 of the west bank that is under complete israeli control one of the challenges of the jaip industrial park is that while most of it is built in area a jericho is under complete control of the palestinian authority the road that will take the goods from the industrial park to the border crossing runs through area c and will need israeli permission to build israeli officials have said that they want to encourage palestinian exports as a way to promote economic peace in the absence of political peace for most of the ambassadors it was their first trip to israel several said they were impressed by jaip its a good experience to be here in palestine and see both the cooperation as well as the problems they the palestinians have to face martin garcia moritan argentinas ambassador to the united nations told the media line i was surprised at how easy it was to go from israel to palestine there were no checkpoints and no borders that was true on the road between jerusalem and jericho the quiet town mentioned in the bible after jericho however the group headed back toward jerusalem then veered north to the kalandiya checkpoint welcome to the palestinian authority welcome to kalandiya qasem said this checkpoint is the most trafficked you will see in the west bank on arrival in ramallah the ambassadors went to the glittery ministry of foreign affairs to meet taysir jaradat the deputy foreign minister in the palestinian authority he said that palestinians remain committed to negotiations with israel and want to revive the peace process which has been dormant for years the palestinian authority also supports a french proposal for an international peace conference which has just been delayed from december to january after he spoke there was a slide presentation titled shattered peace israeli militarism and unilateralism by the plo negotiations support unit the ambassadors also met with huda el jack a prominent palestinian female entrepreneur privately several ambassadors said they would have preferred more of a give and take than a frontal presentation some said they appreciated the visit to ramallah as it enabled them to see both sides of the israeli palestinian conflict several said that although the trip to israel and the west bank was short they left more optimistic about the future than they had arrived after we saw the economic development zone in jericho i became more hopeful adikalie foday sumah sierra leones ambassador to the un told the media line some part of solving the conflict can be poverty reduction youth empowerment and community development this is another way to bring both parties together in confidence
