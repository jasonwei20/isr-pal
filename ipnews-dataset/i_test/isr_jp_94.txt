and the oscar goes to palestine the 86th academy awards ceremony which will be held on sunday in los angeles and which can be seen live in israel at 2 a m on march 3 on both the hot and yes networks will have millions around the world glued to their television screens although there are many israeli films nominated for oscars in recent years this year the only middle eastern film among the nominees is hany abu assads omar the plot of omar bears an odd resemblance to israels entry for a best foreign language film nod yuval adlers bethlehem both are about palestinians who become informers for the shin bet israel security agency and the israelis who work with them but bethlehem did not make the oscar shortlist this year omar seems like a long shot to win the best foreign language award since academy voters arent likely to warm up to a movie whose hero kills an israeli soldier a cambodian film is nominated for the first time rithy prans innovative documentary about the pol pot years the missing picture but its in the lucky to be nominated category thomas vinterbergs suspenseful drama the hunt from denmark is about an accused child molester which voters may find off putting the most intense competition is between paolo sorrentinos mournful fellini esque the great beauty about an aging playboy and felix van groeningens the broken circle breakdown broken circle is likely to have more appeal to younger voters since its a lively tear jerking film about two belgian bluegrass musicians who fall in love and have a child who gets ill its been available on various streaming platforms for months and the actors have been in hollywood promoting it heavily in past years oscar voters had to prove they had seen all five films at official screenings in order to vote in this category so that the award wouldnt automatically go to the only nominee academy members had heard of but few voters had time to see five films in theaters so this year they received screeners and are on an honor system they are only supposed to vote if they have truly seen all five films but knowing hollywoods reputation for disregarding the truth when convenient this rule change is good news for the highest profile nominee the great beauty and bad news for cambodias the missing picture well know tomorrow how it all turned out and for israel theres always next year
