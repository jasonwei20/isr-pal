the devastating terrorist attacks in tel aviv jerusalem and ashkelon which have killed 61 people over nine days underscore the serious shortcomings of the oslo peace accords signed by israel and the palestine liberation organization in 1993 prime minister shimon peres and his labor party ministers refuse to hold yasir arafat to the commitments of the accords including the promise to amend the terrorist provisions of the palestine national covenant in return for israel s handing over land and recognizing the p l o mr arafat promised to publicly reject terrorism and amend the covenant in which 29 out of 33 provisions spell out the group s dedication to fighting the state of israel mr peres himself as foreign minister repeatedly stated that the pledge to amend the covenant was the sine qua non of the accords as he wrote in his book the battle for peace his strategic goal was to obtain in return for return an undertaking from the p l o to recognize israel forswear terrorism finally and irrevocably and to abrogate the provisions of its charter the palestine national covenant which commit the organization to fight for the destruction of the jewish state the p l o received the land bargained for including gaza and jericho but israel s citizens are still waiting for mr arafat to amend the covenant in signing the oslo accords mr arafat agreed that within two months of the date of the inauguration of palestinian authority s elections the p l o would convene and formally approve the necessary changes in regard to the covenant the legislative elections were held on jan 20 the two months will expire on march 20 even as the deadline rapidly approaches the p l o is making no effort to address this issue and it is obvious that the promised date will not be met the problem is that the p l o is not one entity but an umbrella organization mr arafat is but the head of the largest faction fatah according to the covenant the member organizations are required to wage war against israel and cannot negotiate a partial peace any effort to amend the covenant requires a two thirds majority of the more than 400 members of the palestine national council such an outcome seems unlikely since many factions of the p l o do not accept israel s existence and do not recognize its security needs israel is seen as merely a foreign ruler from which patience vigilance and violence will deliver the palestinians the labor party whose political future rests on the success of negotiations with mr arafat had not pressed the p l o leader to amend the covenant but after the attacks and with knesset elections scheduled for may 29 mr peres finally announced yesterday that he would not withdraw troops from seven west bank cities unless the p l o amended its covenant but linking the amendment to the pullout gives mr arafat another way to avoid the formal deadline in the agreement before the oslo accords were signed american law prohibited all diplomatic relations with the p l o but after the peace agreement was signed the united states congress passed legislation that granted the organization 500 million in aid over five years and allowed american officials to meet with the p l o this recognition and money are premised on the p l o s repeated pledge to amend its covenant and members of congress have threatened to cease all contacts and aid if this condition is not met by march 31 if the p l o fails to honor its promise congress and president clinton should not grant another extension the resumption of terrorist attacks in england by the irish republican army underscores the danger of trusting paper promises of peace the i r a promised britain s prime minister john major that it would forswear terrorism however when the negotiations between these two parties stalled the violence quickly returned the flash and thunder of the i r a s bombs may have ended the hope for a peaceful solution to the problems of northern ireland a terrorist group that only promises to cease its violence can never be fully trusted the moment negotiations arrive at a difficult juncture terrorist groups like the p l o and the i r a see no reason to refrain from their guerrilla tactics the leopard does not easily change its spots israel and its supporters in the united states must insure that the p l o upholds the oslo peace accords because of mr arafat s failure to fulfill all of his signed commitments israel must immediately terminate its negotiations with the p l o labor s dangerous policy of turning over land to an enemy still expressly dedicated to israel s destruction must not be permitted to continue similarly the united states should immediately forgo its diplomatic relations with the p l o and freeze all aid if mr arafat s organization cannot amend its covenant it cannot be a partner in peace negotiations in the wake of the past two weeks of bombings the palestine liberation organization must formally and permanently renounce terrorism if the p l o cannot amend the covenant the israeli public has the right to know now before we go any further
