the state of palestine still mired in jew hatred with the palestinians taking israel to the international criminal court and trying to kick israel out of the international soccer league fifa while still boycotting normal constructive personal economic or cultural ties with israel their war against the jews continues even if pope francis whom i respect has been seduced by palestinian self pity to recognize the state of palestine even if much of the world continues to blame israel exclusively the fact remains palestinian rhetoric and behavior reflect their honest intentions their official organs and most of their leaders seek israels destruction and hate the jewish people not just zionists so much they keep their people miserable rather than make any accommodation with the jewish state the palestinians self destructive commitment to delegitimizing israel rather than building their state or improving their lives proves they are motivated by bigotry pope francis ignored those realities added to the jewish peoples collective anguish and showed he believed in ghosts by recognizing the state of palestine a phantom entity whether or not he called the bds bully stalemate king and terrorist cheerleader mahmoud abbas an angel of peace is irrelevant the popes recognition discourages peace by encouraging palestinian intransigence and extremism without encouraging palestinian compromise and realism i understand the popes need to mollify palestinians palestinian christians and churches are vulnerable to the whims of cruel neighbors who have destroyed christian religious sites raped young christian girls brutalized christian families flattering the palestinian authority is an attempt to help oppressed christians who are suffering en masse and leaving in droves boy those pesky facts are annoying could it be that palestinian christians thrive under the allegedly oppressive jewish state while suffering under noble palestinian rule perhaps the palestinians arent angels of peace in joining the pile on against israel pope francis joined todays two most anti christian forces the anti religious far left rooted in godless communism and islamism targeting israel is their ideological glue overriding many clashing beliefs the catholic church should resist this unholy red green alliance holding palestinians accountable reflects respect by contrast this whole statehood dance perpetuates the palestinian desire to dodge responsibility and live in a world of one way streets without reality checks or mutual obligations declaring statehood is a powerful revolutionary act it tells the world we are ready to run our country control our national destiny and take responsibility for our citizens asking for recognition without declaring statehood is like hoping to become a famous actor without memorizing any lines you want the glory without working hard or taking risks the palestinians wont declare statehood because it would violate the oslo agreement under which the palestinian authority functions it would derail the palestinian gravy train from israel the united states and europe which has made palestinians the worlds largest per capita recipients of international foreign aid a recent congressional research service report observed moreover statehood might complicate the palestinians simplistic whodunit narrative blaming the jewish state for everything if abbas were an angel of peace he would stop honoring terrorists as martyrs would stop boycotting or delegitimizing israel and start building the palestinian economy whenever abbas celebrates terrorists and bashes israel he lessens the chances of a palestinian state whenever a palestinian rejects healthy economic cultural or political ties with israelis or jews perpetuating this self destructive anti normalization drive the chances of a palestinian state diminish if palestinians want a state let them build one rather than turning their people into the worlds most greedy welfare kings and queens let them tap the entrepreneurial genius reflected in the palestinian diaspora and build the palestinian economy the situation would look different if first class hotels welcomed tourists to the gaza seacoast and to historic bethlehem and hebron imagine how much trust would develop if more israeli and palestinian economic ventures flourished imagine what would have happened if the palestinians had accepted secretary of state john kerrys 4 billion plan to double the palestinian economy a thriving safe prosperous pre state of palestine would be great for the palestinians and reassure israelis most of whom would happily cooperate eagerly compromise and enjoy living next to a neighbor that wishes to outdo them economically not destroy them militarily or humiliate them diplomatically instead anti normalization continues and palestinians rejected kerrys plan the pas economic adviser mohammad mustafa said the pas priorities are not economic they could achieve more politically through financial power rather than violence the palestinians are like the cowboy in mel brooks blazing saddles who escapes the bad guys by putting a gun to his own neck and taking himself hostage the palestinians have been holding themselves hostage for too long the vatican the icc fifa and the rest of the world should be smarter than blazing saddles idiot townsfolk call the palestinian bluff and challenge abbas the angel of peace to become an engine of prosperity then peace for his people and the region the author is a professor of history at mcgill university and is
