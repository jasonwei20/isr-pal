import a conflict that is thousands of kilometers away according to radio adn the jewish community also condemned the graffiti and expressed solidarity with the palestinian community in recent days the imported conflict has also been fought on the pages of major chilean newspaper el mercurio after the palestinian community of chile published a large advert in the paper denouncing 50 years of occupation and apartheid in palestine the jewish community retaliated sunday with another advert in collaboration with the world jewish congress which said for peace it takes two followed by a timeline of proposals the palestinians rejected another point of contention between the two communities has been israels new policy of barring boycott divestment and sanctions bds activists from entering the country in april israel barred entry to the executive director of the palestinian federation of chile anwar makhlouf and this month refused entry to a 24 year old member of the federation named omar salame stirring uproar among the palestinian community makhlouf had already traveled to israel the west bank and other countries in the region but returning to israel on an el al flight authorities accused him of lying about the nature of his trip the chilean foreign ministry condemned israel for having deported salame and the palestinian federation upped its media campaign for chile to sanction israel in response the chilean community in israel then sent a letter to foreign minister heraldo munoz backing israels decision and accusing salame of promoting a boycott of a racist character and inciting hatred against israel and the jewish people munoz himself denied any involvement in bds activities and pointed out that he had flown on an israeli airline agosin told the jerusalem post sunday that while the community does not comment on decisions taken by other countries all states have the right to take such decisions citing a report released last november by news outlet emol agosin points out that last year over 790 chileans were deported or denied entry to various countries around the world but that the foreign ministry only protested when the country in question was israel its like israel is a different country and you have to take different decision when you are talking about israel he remarks he highlights that bds proponents comprise a very small but active group in chile that wants to import the problems of the middle east to our country we are very worried about the situation between the palestinian and jewish communities he said expressing concern over the escalating tensions earlier this month the university of alberto hurtado canceled a conference on israeli archaeology due to pressure by the bds movement the problem is that were importing the conflict and not exporting peace agosin added describing chile as a peaceful beautiful country
