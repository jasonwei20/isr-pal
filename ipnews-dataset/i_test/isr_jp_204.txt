can israel and palestine learn from colombia it is rare to hear any good news about conflicts de escalating this week the world rallied around the implementation of a cease fire between the notorious and shadowy farc revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the colombia government the conflict has dragged on for over 50 years the most obvious and optimistic point is that a long and bloody past need not be the future forever but other useful points are emerging for comparison and maybe inspiration no short cuts or catharsis the farc has agreed to end its military campaign and join the legal political process reported cnn this is a reminder that when it comes to undesirable partners even brutally violent ones there are few options either they magically disappear rare or they join political mechanisms and state institutions the more common models seen in both northern ireland and in kosovo as well as in palestine with the plo and israels own pre state fighting forces with a quarter of a million people dead through the course of the conflict and millions more displaced accepting farc into political life will be no small task the economist cites a local expression swallowing toads to describe how this will feel for colombians to offset the resistance to integrating farc two mechanisms are to be established a tribunal and restrictions on their activity and disarmament this formulation shows that militant groups can also agree to concessions when the process is ripe the agreement will now be put to a referendum on october 2 it will be a critical test the economist breezily reports that polls predict a two to one victory for a yes vote but this optimism seems unwarranted with significant conflicting data available the most worrying findings are from particularly credible institute reports say that ipsos polling shows 50 percent against the agreement and just 39 in favor worse this data is a reversal from just months before showing that trends are unstable and support may be falling a washington advocacy group on latin america gathered several polls showing the precipitous drop in support between june and august and concluded the possibility that a no vote could undo the entire peace effort is too great to be dismissed colombia is about to face a bitter internal political struggle the incumbent leader who negotiated the deal juan manuel santos is facing crisis level ratings roughly 25 popularity a former president is the incumbents main political rival and the primary leader of opposition to the agreement for the referendum vote his favorability ratings are roughly double those of santos according to reports on the ipsos poll but as quintin oliver a leader of northern irelands yes campaign for the good friday agreements in 1998 pointed out the latter will face major lack of social support for his position no ngos no artists no celebrities no sports stars no obvious business community backing in israel and palestine this key role for civil society is also a reminder that the hardship of pro peace activity from daily despair to anti normalization and outright political attacks are not in vain peace is a long and frustrating game but at the key moment an infrastructure of support can make a difference perhaps even the sophisticated advertising campaign that began a decade ago encouraging de commissioning of farc soldiers described in a remarkable episode of this american life contributed slowly to the current process as well that was government led a sort of reverse hasbara public diplomacy the bottom line is that the road is twisted and belabored full of fresh trauma and setbacks long term efforts for peace by the government peace advocates and other social figures may seem futile for years that is until the moment of potential when all hands are needed in the push for peace the author is a policy fellow at the mitvim institute she is also a public opinion expert and an international political and strategic consultant and an adjunct lecturer at tel aviv university she recently published a article titled the curse of stagnation and the need for conflict comparisons seeking a breakthrough towards israeli palestinian conflict resolution
