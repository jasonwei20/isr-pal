palestinians report increase in tourism to the west bank for easter holiday the palestinian authority has announced a 50 percent rise in tourism activity in march compared to the same period last year a report by the pa tourism and antiquities police released on tuesday said tourism in the palestinian territories had increased during march with a considerable rise in guests registered in local hotels the police report stated that 464 000 tourists had traveled to the west bank 137 000 of whom were international passport holders and 83 000 were israeli arabs the number of guests staying in hotels saw a 50 increase compared with last years figures the report said noting that 81 154 travelers had booked hotels 70 047 foreign nationals 9 426 locals and 1 681 israeli arabs last march only 39 521 tourists stayed in west bank hotels the statement read palestinian tourism professionals approached by the jerusalem post said they were unaware of the precise statistics but credited the rise in tourism to the natural ebb and flow of the seasons and to a calmer and more peaceful atmosphere in the region last year saw the idfs operation cast lead in gaza which negatively affected all tourism in the region it makes sense that numbers are up after all this is the holiday season and many pilgrims choose to visit the regions holy sites during easter said johnny sayegh director of inspiration tours which operates out of east jerusalem everything affects tourism security politics the economy lately things have gotten better its been quiet so the tourists are coming sayegh said most of the tourist groups with which he worked were groups of pilgrims visiting the west bank to see the biblical sites mainly bethlehem and jericho i have many clients from western europe and the english speaking world most of them are catholic pilgrims said sayegh he added that in the last few months there had been a marked increase of visitors from eastern european countries like poland georgia and romania george abdalla who together with his father gabriel runs sinbad tour travel agency said that in addition to the traditional pilgrimage tours he enjoyed marketing what he called alternative tours some people arent interested in visiting churches and graves he explained for them i gladly offer three day spa packages at the dead sea or four days of leisure in eilat abdalla said he had recently sent tourists on a visit to a kibbutz in the negev where they could see modern agricultural techniques and absorb the desert tranquility according to abdalla one of the main impediments to the development of palestinian tourism is the israeli security measures namely the checkpoints israeli checkpoints have a huge effect on our itineraries he said they are unpredictable and they take a long time to go through we always tell our clients that schedules are subject to change because of the checkpoints people tend to understand but its a genuine hassle abdalla believes that the west bank has a huge potential for tourism saying the competitive prices and the good service are natural drawing points he also said tourism was immensely important for the development of the palestinian economy tourism is an economic engine that helps lift other industries a group of 60 tourists who visit generate income for many people in a varied range of industries in the west bank it is the most welcome form of business and should be the governments no 1 priority even before agriculture he said while the majority of palestinian tour operators like sinbad and inspiration work mainly with pilgrims an emerging phenomenon in the west bank is foreign nationals who come to see the effects of the conflict firsthand rami kassis director of the alternative tour group atg specializes in promoting justice tourism tours and pilgrimages that include critical examinations of the history culture and politics of the holy land kassis said that the people using his companys services were student groups on fact finding missions church groups concerned with issues of social justice international solidarity groups and ngos and political organizations that wanted to learn about the conflict kassis takes groups to visit refugee camps communities affected by the security barrier local peace activists and universities he said that while his company was one of the smaller tour providers in the west bank it provided these tours for between 2 000 2 5000 people a year atgs web site also features a special section for jewish travelers wishing to visit the west bank jewish travelers wearing star of david jewelry the kippa or loudly referring to themselves as jews may be misunderstood to be israelis and supporters of the occupation he said this is not to say that israelis are necessarily in danger in palestine many israeli activists work side by side with palestinians however israelis can be a target of palestinian militant groups jewish travelers are encouraged to keep all of these details in mind and to be selective in whom they tell about their heritage he added it is our hope that as more jews who oppose israeli policies visit palestine and make their positions known to palestinians this selectiveness will be less necessary
