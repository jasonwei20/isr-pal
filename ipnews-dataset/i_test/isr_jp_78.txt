liberman very disappointed in swedish decision to recognize palestine in op ed in stockholm paper foreign minister says friendly governments dont second guess friends on national security issues friendly governments do not act to undermine the national security of their friends or presume to know better how to contend with the challenges they face foreign minister avigdor liberman wrote in a swedish daily on tuesday in reaction to stockholms decision to recognize palestine liberman in an op ed in the mass circulation dagens nyheter newspaper wrote that he was very disappointed to learn of new swedish prime minister stefan l fvens announcement during his inaugural address last week to recognize a palestinian state this announcement was not intended to serve as a genuine solution to a foreign problem liberman wrote it was intended so it seems to placate a certain sector in swedish public opinion it is to be regretted when internal considerations determine a counterproductive and irresponsible foreign policy on monday the foreign ministry called in the swedish ambassador to protest the move with the entire middle east aflame not to mention other regions in the world experiencing strife and instability the undue focus on the israeli palestinian conflict runs counter to all logic liberman wrote dismissing the idea that resolving the israeli palestinian conflict would serve as some kind of magical solution to the many other problems in the region also he added more than 800 iranians have been executed by the iranian regime including journalists poets intellectuals and women accused of immodesty since iranian president hassan rouhani came to power last year in addition as the world has witnessed all too vividly in recent weeks fanatic terrorist organizations such as isis al qaida islamic jihad hezbollah and hamas have been committing countless atrocities some of them even aspiring to acquire weapons of mass destruction he wrote now what of all these appalling developments is emphasized in the statement of prime minister l fven the israeli palestinian issue this is not merely a matter of imbalance it is a matter of fundamental unfairness liberman also asked where l fvens outrage was with regard to israeli human rights and the millions of israelis who have been subjected for years on end to waves of terrorism and to thousands of rocket attacks the foreign minister said this reveals the hypocrisy of focusing disproportionately on the palestinians when much of the world around us is blazing regarding swedens support for palestinian unilateral measures such as a declaration of statehood he wrote do those who support unilateral measures really believe that the israeli government any israeli government could abandon the security of its citizens and israels vital national interests just because someone outside the region believes wrongly that endorsing the palestinian position will resolve the conflict would the swedish government be willing to abandon the interests of its citizens due to external attempts to impose conditions in a matter of national importance i believe the answer is clear
