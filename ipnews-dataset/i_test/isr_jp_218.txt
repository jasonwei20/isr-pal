the wests refusal to recognize the religious basis for the israeli palestinian conflict every few years like clockwork an american administration comes along that thinks it can solve the israeli palestinian conflict while politicians and pundits annually march through the halls of the aipac national meeting talking about a two state solution with security for israel their motivations are genuine but they cant seem to learn the lessons of previous failures this is especially important now as us president donald trump seems bent on solving this heretofore intractable conflict to many americans jews and arabs are simply fighting over territory so the logical answer is to simply divide the land this has been the strategy for over 100 years but this approach ignores the fact that this dispute like so many others in the middle east is primarily a war of islamic religious supremacy the path to peace is not one a cartographer can delineate we need to understand the ideological reasons why simply dividing the land has received consistently negative palestinian responses despite offers of 100 of the territory with land swaps until that understanding takes hold in the western diplomatic mind negotiations will continue to fail promises will continue to be broken and violence will continue to follow as anshel pfeffer wrote in the guardian a few years back accepting that the israel palestine conflict is also a bitter religious war runs counter to the international communitys preferred solutions which is a central reason that none of these solutions have worked america for decades has refused to recognize the obvious in the muslim and arab world decisions are not based on western democratic standards there are no secular arab states in the arab world there is no separation of church and state the last secular muslim state turkey has become islamized over the past 14 years a future palestinian state will have islam as the dominant aspect of its governing system despite western wishful thinking to the contrary hamas is an islamist regime that bases its desire to destroy israel on islamic texts and the muslim brotherhood interpretation of a worldwide caliphate but is todays palestinian authority really so secular compared to hamas as the un eu and the us state department claim if you examine statements by pa political and religious leaders and from its state sponsored television the reality is quite different in 1979 the iranian revolution showed both sunnis and shiites that islamism not secular muslim nationalism is the winning formula over time the corruption of the secular plo pa fatah and their failure to end the occupation of muslim lands all combined to transform secular palestinian society toward islamist nationalism according to palestinian media watch the pa preaches ribat an uncompromising islamic obligation to liberate land said to be islamic israel is considered to be islamic land that must be liberated for allah the tragic conclusion is that the palestinian authority has adopted and is teaching its people the messages of radical islam president abbas appointed sheikh muhammad hussein as mufti the most senior religious leader in the pa hussein said the land of palestine is wakf it must not be relinquished nor must any part of it be sold it is the duty of the leaders of the islamic nation and its peoples to liberate palestine and jerusalem bewilderingly the trump administration may also be approaching the israeli palestinian conflict emphasizing the territorial aspects while sidelining the primary islamic root cause of the conflict when speaking to the west the palestinians have perfected the art of doublespeak telling americans that if only israel returns the stolen land over the 67 border all will be well as the conflict is just about territory trump refers to a great real estate deal between israel and the palestinians but you cannot have an ultimate deal if you dont factor in the primary islamic roots of the conflict which animate palestinian arab choices both the pa and hamas lack of acceptance of israel as a jewish state and denial of zionism as a legitimate national movement are based on islamic beliefs hamas states this clearly but the west closes its eyes to the islamist nature of the pa plo and fatah claiming they are strictly secular movements the pas childrens tv programs teach that jews are allahs enemies sons of pigs or oh you who murdered allahs pious prophets or as long as my heart is my koran and my city jerusalem is the eternal capital of palestine if you are really serious about resolving the israeli palestinian conflict for the sake of the parties involved and for the security and interests of america and its allies you must acknowledge that palestinian arab decisions are judged through the lens of islamic law history and tradition the author is the founder and director of mepin the middle east political and information network he
