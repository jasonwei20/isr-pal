the truth about rihanna not the truthiness the battle to get haaretz to correct a false story about the pop star singing for palestine may not be the most important fight but it was worth it what would you do if you opened a news website and saw a blaring example of truthiness if a newspaper that people trust printed a complete fabrication that conveniently fits a very specific agenda often touted by that publication after i wrote my review of pop star rihannas concert in tel aviv earlier this week i did some googling to see how she was received elsewhere and i found that a haaretz reporter must have gone to some other top secret rihanna concert in tel aviv the headline read all rihanna sees is palestine but israelis didnt seem to care according to reporter amy klein the pop star changed the lyrics of her recent single pour it up from all i see are dollar signs to all i see is palestine i was at that rihanna concert and i promise i was not dancing too crazily to hear the lyrics as my review attests i wasnt having the greatest time and a palestine shout out would have been noticeable plus madonna was booed for talking politics at her last concert in israel and the only booing i heard was before rihanna came on an hour late finally no other israeli news source not even haaretz in hebrew reported the palestine switch up klein also insisted that rihanna avoided saying israel because she kept shouting tel aviv during her songs which is a weird claim does rihanna say great britain when shes in london plus the pop star used the hashtag israel on an instagram photo that day incensed i used the most immediate weapon available to me twitter and wrote if every newspaper in the country sent people to the rihanna concert and only haaretz heard a pro palestinian comment it probably didnt happen then two things seemed to happened at once news sources like buzzfeed and the huffington post as well as several sites in the arab world picked up the story some referring back to my tweet with comments like the israeli media is not happy i started receiving tweets like if haaretz reported about a pro palestinian comment its possibly because all the other papers are more right wing the story that was being written was that not only did rihanna make a pro palestinian comment but i was part of some vast right wing conspiracy as hillary clinton would put it to cover up the truth for all the conspiracy theorists had rihanna said all i see is palestine i would have done my duty as a journalist and reported what happened and i would have put it in the context of the efforts of the palestinian boycott divestment and sanctions movement to convince rihanna not to perform in israel you might think who cares if a pop star makes a pro palestinian comment i would have thought the same and left things with my original snarky tweet had the story not started to reach international audiences but once it made waves around the world it took on another aspect and could appear like a bds victory see the palestinian bds movement tried to convince rihanna to cancel the concert but she like many other artists ignored them plus by saying all i see is palestine while in tel aviv she would be sympathizing with the most extreme anti israel elements who think the palestinian states borders should be from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea in any case there were more important news stories that day but i thought it was worth taking a few minutes to tweet to buzzfeed world editor miriam elder that i dont think the story is true and respond to those who doubted me that i was at the concert and heard nothing about palestine before moving on with my busy workday wrapping up municipal election results that evening twitter follower akiva wienerkur sent me a video of rihanna singing pour it up in tel aviv that proved without a doubt that she did not switch dollar signs for palestine i once again sent the video to the doubters it was retweeted many times that evening and sent to the twitter accounts of haaretz and its editor in chief aluf benn i must say that it was early enough that the newspaper was unlikely to have gone to press already the next morning i woke up to find that a friend sent me a photo of haaretzs front page the rihanna palestine article was on the cover hasbara ngo standwithuss israel director michael dickson disclosure i participated in their fellowship as a college student wrote a much shared blog post bashing the newspaper and hebrew language media criticism site presspectiva did the same at that point i was more than incensed i was livid i could not and still cannot understand how they printed that story hours after a video disproving it was disseminated online one can argue whether new journalism is a legitimate style of reporting or not but haaretz allows its reporters to adopt it and as such does not emphasize objectivity in its news pages the way the jerusalem post does that is why for example haaretz published an article earlier this year on palestinian rock throwing in the news section in which amira hass wrote throwing stones is the birthright and duty of anyone subject to foreign rule i dont know amy klein ive never met amy klein and i am by no means saying she intentionally lied but perhaps she was thinking about the bds pressure on rihanna or maybe she was working on a story related to palestinians and had palestine on the mind and misheard people make mistakes and this was a mistake however she or one of her editors should have tried to verify the story in the first place and should have pulled it immediately once the video emerged in any case i found myself at the center of a twitter whirlwind on thursday morning i tried to juggle advocating on twitter for haaretz to correct the story with the job im being paid for to report on the jerusalem post diplomatic conference i have to give credit where its due to dickson who did the real heavy lifting in contacting haaretz directly i just riled up the crowds on twitter where admittedly its almost too easy to make mountains out of molehills and foment arguments by thursday afternoon haaretz corrected the story twice first to say that rihanna didnt reference palestine and then to say that there wasnt anything anti israel in her shouting tel aviv yair rosenberg a reporter at tablet tweeted a corrected buzzfeed article writing moral of the story dont mess with lahav harkov a washington post blog wrote up the story referring to me i started getting congratulatory tweets which were flattering but also kind of confusing all this for a few tweets after all other people like dickson were the ones who made them go viral in any case even though i didnt bring peace to the middle east or convince iran to stop developing nuclear weapons im glad i won a battle small as it may be in the war on israels image and the fight for truth in journalism im a proud zionist and if thats the one thing clouding my journalistic objectivity so be it
