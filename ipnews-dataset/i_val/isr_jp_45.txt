the biggest story of the year though was actually about a movie shmulik maozs foxtrot and the one person who refused to see it minister for culture and sport miri regev to no ones surprise foxtrot won the ophir award the israeli oscar for best picture in september as well as seven other awards which made it israels official entry for consideration for a best foreign language film academy award last week it made the shortlist for this award which consists of nine films out of the 92 submitted by different countries some of those involved in the byzantine process of choosing the nominees from the shortlist say that it is very likely to get an oscar nomination israeli movies have been nominated 10 times in this category including four nominations in the past decade but none has ever won if and when foxtrot does receive a nomination in late january you can expect the controversy sparked by regev to reignite when the first clip from foxtrot which tells the story of a grieving family whose son is killed in the military was released last winter about 60 seconds showing a soldier dancing with his rifle at a checkpoint as a camel walked away israeli film lovers immediately posted and shared it it had its world premiere at the venice international film festival in september but the israeli general public is not particularly interested in the venice film festival and it seemed that the movie would be a critical success that would play art houses here and abroad without generating headlines like lebanon enter regev stage right after the movie won the silver lion grand jury prize in venice regev said that it undermined the state of israel she was presumably referring to a disturbing sequence featuring violence and an idf cover up regev pointedly said she had not seen the movie and would not see it confirming the incorrect assumption among a certain segment of the population that virtually all israeli cinema is anti israel and so beneath contempt unworthy of any consideration except condemnation never mind that the film is filled with compassion for the grieving family of an israeli soldier or that it portrays soldiers as humane and complex people in the minds of many foxtrot was the work of the enemy and enemies must be fought its a sad truth that the importance of any achievement in the middle east these days can be measured by whether it inspires violence or the threat of violence by that standard foxtrot was a resounding success maoz received death threats its star lior ashkenazi received death threats threats were made against ashkenazis five year old daughter regev did not condemn these threats but blamed the filmmakers themselves in the end the foxtrot controversy got people talking about movies and there is no question that the israeli movie industry is thriving as never before foxtrot was just one of the important stories in the israeli film industry this year and anyone watching the ophir awards broadcast could see what another one was the rise of israeli arab filmmakers exemplified by the success of maysaloun hamouds in between the movie which is about three arab women two muslims and a christian who share an apartment in tel aviv showed a world that most israelis had never seen before the characters were vibrant vulnerable and attractive struggling to create a life for themselves in a country where they are a minority and fighting both for and against their own traditions in keeping with the spirit of the middle east this movie also ignited controversy and death threats against its director in this case from the islamic religious right because of a religious muslim character they felt was portrayed negatively hamoud laughed off the threats knowing she had made a movie that was too good to ignore and that this came with the territory two actresses from the movie shaden kanboura who quoted martin luther king jr in her acceptance speech at the ophirs which was very much in keeping with the spirit of the night and mouna hawa who won ophir awards for best actress and best supporting actress respectively in an unexpected development in between and personal affairs were shown at the toronto palestine film festival in september in spite of bds calls to boycott all movies with israeli involvement along with three other films directed by israelis apparently these movies were so compelling they convinced the programmers of a palestinian film festival to break with bds regev has repeatedly condemned the israeli film industry for its elitism so did she have words of praise for hamoud haj and srour who are certainly not from the ashkenazi boys club that dominated the israeli movie industry for decades well no i dont think these were the kind of filmmakers regev had in mind when she called for more diversity be careful what you wish for there was some news in the israeli film world that even regev would like however as movies by directors and about characters far from north tel aviv were extremely popular here and abroad the biggest israeli hit of the year was the womens balcony a comedy drama by emil ben shimon it was written by shlomit nehama and was based on her experiences growing up in the bukharan quarter of jerusalem the movie is about a mizrahi synagogue that experiences a tragedy its balcony collapses gravely injuring its elderly rabbi and leaving the place in ruins during the course of the renovation the men in the community come under the sway of a charismatic young rabbi who advises them to rebuild the synagogue without a womens balcony effectively banishing females from the most important place in the community and the women revolt this quintessentially israeli story sold more than 340 000 tickets in israel during its first four months of release just for comparison if a movie here sells 100 000 tickets i receive a celebratory press release and much more surprising earned more than 1 million in the us in an interview with the jerusalem post nehama said what matters is how much you connect to the characters if you connect emotionally they can be from any culture a comedy about a young ultra orthodox woman rama burshteins the wedding plan which was originally titled through the wall in english was also an unlikely success abroad earning nearly 1 5 million in the us in the first 60 years since the establishment of israel according to honig there were more than 700 movies made in israel and only about 30 were filmed in jerusalem but in the nine years since the fund started contributing to movie budgets 60 films and television series have been made in jerusalem but many may not realize that early in his career he also made a movie in jerusalem rage and glory 1984 a drama about a stern group lehi terror cell during the 1940s the movie has been digitally restored by the jerusalem cinematheque and the israel film archive and the premiere of this newly restored version was one of the highlights of the jerusalem jewish film festival this restored version will be shown at cinematheques around the country part of the trend of israelis of all backgrounds telling their stories on film was on display in two movies that debuted at the jerusalem film festival in the summer matan yairs scaffolding which won the festivals top prize in a competitive year and eliran elyas doubtful both of which were about teachers in schools in working class neighborhoods trying to help difficult and disadvantaged students as some made money pleasing local audiences other directors headed abroad making movies in other countries mostly in the us the highest profile example of this trend was norman by joseph cedar a movie about an elderly jewish new york fixer played by richard gere who exploits a connection he has to the israeli prime minister the prime minister was portrayed by lior ashkenazi the actor who also stars in foxtrot aharon keshales and navot papushado the directors of the popular israeli thrillers rabies and big bad wolves announced that they were making once upon a time in palestine an english language movie described as a genre bending thriller with elements of spaghetti westerns war movies romantic comedies and silent movies set in british ruled palestine in 1946 that sounds like it will be something to see and why shouldnt the israeli film industry have its own quentin tarantino influenced epic
