israeli arab leaders see bleak future if us drops support for two state solution statements by a white house official to the effect that israeli palestinian peace does not have to entail palestinian statehood touched off consternation on wednesday among israeli arab politicians even though it was not immediately clear if the remarks would be personally embraced by president donald trump the official said in advance of a meeting at the white house between trump and prime minister benjamin netanyahu that it was up to israelis and palestinians to decide on the shape of a peace deal whether this would be through a two state solution or something else if the remarks become the official stance of washington that would mark a break with longstanding us policy viewing a two state solution as the only viable path to peace mk zuheir bahloul zionist union said such a shift could be cause to cry for generations because two states for two peoples is the plan that is the most operative on the ground any other decision can be fraught with disaster two states for two peoples is a practicable solution and if we dont work on something that is defined we will continue to tread water until the end of our lives and we will have only victims it is a shame for every soul that will be lost it is too bad that they have now clouded this matter bahloul said he doubts it would be possible to have one state with equal rights for all it wont happen he said this country defines itself as jewish and democratic and it wont relinquish its jewish definition this means that one state for two peoples will be subordinate to the jewishness of the state and not necessarily to the democracy of the state there is great doubt whether there would be equality of rights because even today there is no equality between arabs and jews mk yousef jabareen joint list said that if the trump administration does back off from the two state solution it will be going against an international consensus including arab and muslim countries and the palestinian leadership the support of the us is definitely crucial and any change in policy would be a slap in the face of the international community he said i think the two state solution is still the most feasible solution however because of increased settlement building we have started the countdown for the end of this solution unfortunately the actual alternative on the ground doesnt seem to be one democratic state or a binational state but a jewish zionist state controlling all of mandatory palestine and leaving palestinians with some kind of self rule that would look like bantustans he said jabareen said he hopes other countries will exert influence on washington so that it does not abandon the two state solution there is a need to emphasize that resolving the conflict is not just a palestinian interest but is an international interest and that there can be no peace without addressing the rights of the palestinian people i hope other players in the international arena like the european union will make it clear to the us that it needs to stick to international standards mk masud gnaim joint list said that if the position enunciated by the white house official turns out to be the official stance of the trump administration this would be very dangerous because they are taking the right wing israeli side that does not want a two state solution that wants to impose the existing situation of occupation this will cause the palestinians to not view the americans as objective and able to lead negotiations or any future peace plan and will cause the palestinians to withdraw from any peace negotiations because all negotiations in the past and the present are built on the principle of two states an end to occupation and establishing an independent palestinian state in the view of awad abdel fattah former president of the balad party which is part of the joint list israeli settlement construction has already killed the two state solution i think that by killing the two state solution the israeli government never thought of a one state solution it thought of controlling all of palestine without giving equality to palestinians i think palestinians and israelis should think of their strategies and push toward a one state solution based on equality and justice he said the one state solution gives a human vision for all a moral vision when you stop pushing for separation or partition it is better than separating the two peoples the two state solution has no advantages and it is impossible now the advantage of the one state solution is that people make a shift in their thinking instead of thinking they are enemies they will think they can live together they should think that palestinians and israelis can live together this would stop wars and bloodshed and people can be educated about democracy and about living together abdel fattah said he believes however that the trump administration and netanyahu are now headed toward interim solutions such as improving the economic situation of palestinians or giving them greater autonomy unfortunately they are still thinking that it is still possible to tame the palestinians by giving them economic benefits he said this wont happen it will only push the palestinians to more resistance if they come with provisional solutions
