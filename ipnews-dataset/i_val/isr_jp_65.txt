despite it all economic peace he further said he would not hand over the palestinians territories before strengthening the west bank economy fearing that radical islamists backed by archenemy iran would seize power there here we are two years later palestinians have received more than passing grades from the world bank and the imf in their state and institutional building efforts anyone who visits the west bank immediately takes notice of the rapid economic development that has taken place despite the palestinian rejection of netanyahus economic peace plans so far the basic theory has worked economic growth has created a kind of deterrence against a return to violence people remember all too well the horrific tragic losses of the second intifada years the loss of life and the destruction of property palestinians do not want to return to the chaos of the aftermath of the collapse of the palestinian authority and the complete reoccupation by israel of all palestinian cities there has been progress on the ground and even if there is no political progress towards a negotiated peace settlement or an end to the occupation for the time being palestinians do not want to lose what has been achieved netanyahu may be able to feel that his economic peace plan is widely responsible for the current stability but it would be very wrong for him not to admit that the primary success belongs to the palestinian leadership and the palestinian people the decision of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas to implement palestines road map obligation to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism to re establish law and order to unite the palestinian security forces and to place them under the rule of the political echelon are the main elements that have enabled economic growth over the past years pa prime minister salaam fayyad and his government have demonstrated success in developing the institutions of statehood including the emphasis that has been placed on the need for people servicing public government institutions the international community has played its positive role as well by providing the necessary funding to enable the implementation of these plans israel removed checkpoints and made movement somewhat easier but all international reports on the palestinian economy still say that the primary obstacle to greater economic growth in palestine are israeli limitations on movement and control of the economy so what now there are no negotiations for peace and there seems to be no real plan to get the parties back to the table the international financial crash is having a direct impact on the palestinian authority as well the us punishment of palestine because of its decision to go to the united nations is also a real blow to the state building process and if israel continues to withhold palestinian tax revenues this will be a fatal knockout to the palestinian government and the economy soon we will see massive layoffs closings of businesses new hotels and restaurants shutting down palestinian software ventures new start ups factories all over the west bank will close their doors the palestinian authority will not be able to pay its salaries the pa is the largest employer in the west bank how long will it take under this scenario before there is a return to violence cogat has also announced that it will allow furniture to be exported from gaza even with hamas in power in gaza apparently someone is beginning to understand that it is better for our neighbors to be gainfully employed than hungry frustrated and angry un officials have also noted that israel is now allowing several important construction projects to take place including the building of new schools this is a very good step in the right direction the hamas government in gaza has profited from israels economic siege the underground tunnel economy has been extremely profitable for them and they have systematized the means of collecting high revenues from this opening gazas economy once again is the right thing to do so if there is no political process taking place that will lead us back to negotiations and perhaps to peace and if israel successfully blocked palestines attempt to gain international recognition of statehood without negotiations perhaps the best plan to implement now is a continuation and even an enhancement of netanyahus economic peace it is no replacement for political peace palestine must achieve statehood and israel must end its control over the palestinian people but political constellations locally and internationally do not seem to enable political progress at this time the main policy effort must be to prevent a return to violence the next step of this plan must be to release control over territories in the west bank that are located in area c lands under full israel control area c comprises 62 percent of the west bank with israeli encouragement large infrastructure development projects could be launched in the development of a transportation corridor energy including solar and wind projects and even the construction of at least one new city which could be used to absorb palestinian refugees from places like lebanon in the future at a time when we have no political horizon and no statesman like leadership that can propel us into the future when peace agreements will be possible we must avoid political collapse and economic doom that will lead to violence economic peace may be the only answer for the present time the writer is the co ceo of ipcri the israel
