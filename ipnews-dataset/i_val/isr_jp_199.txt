palestinian terrorist organization pflp lashes out at post expose blasts israeli media and political parties the pflp designated by the us and eu as a terrorist organization issued an angry rambling statement on saturday denouncing israeli media israeli parties and german lawmakers for urging chancellor angela merkels administration to outlaw the popular front for the liberation of palestine and hezbollah in the federal republic the pflp response appears to be related to a series of late august articles in the jerusalem post on the pflp joining forces with the marxist leninist party of germany mlpd in a campaign to secure entry into the bundestag in the september 24 federal election the pflp statement referenced israeli media in its statement on its website saying the israeli press is working overtime in an attempt to spread falsehoods and fear on an international level about the pflp the pflp has over the years launched scores of terrorist attacks against israelis resulting in large numbers of deaths the pflp said political parties in israel attacking the palestinian and arab community in germany are attempting to spread fear in the community as well as attacking german progressive forces particularly the marxist leninist party of germany under the auspices of a complete deception and a big lie five knesset lawmakers along with six of their counterparts from various parties in the bundestag sent a pressing letter in early august to german interior minister thomas de maiziere urging him to ban the lebanese organization hezbollah and the pflp because they are terrorist entities the israeli mks who signed the letter were from likud yesh atid zionist union and kulanu the pflp continued this campaign has been carried out under the pretext of banning the popular front for the liberation of palestine and the lebanese resistance group hezbollah we see this as a racist campaign that attempts to suppress the palestinian lebanese and arab communities from participation in public life politics and integration by pushing new immigrants into ghettoization which is harmful on political social and economic levels to the entire german society volker beck a green party mp and head of the german israel parliamentary group told the post on sunday the pflp affirmed its will to destroy israel in its statement he added the pflp is afraid that the sleeping german interior minister will now wake up and issue a ban of the pflp according to the pflp statement we the pflp trust that the german security institutions know very well the peaceful intentions of our communities and their organizations in berlin and elsewhere in germany and that our community stands against all forms of racism hatred violence and oppression that harm german society the pflp denied it is campaigning with the mlpd it is a well established fact that the pflp does not run in any elections anywhere in the world nor does it seek to participate in any such elections wrote the pflp however campaign literature and screenshots from the mlpd website show that the pflp is on the alliance list with the mlpd the pflp added we salute the marxist leninist party of germany and the internationalist list for demanding the removal of the pflp from terror lists such a listing is an example of injustice that can never help in achieving peace and justice in the region and the world beck who has led the political campaign to uncover the pflps efforts to enter the parliament told the post the mlpd is in panic over its party privileges and party assets due to the media coverage the pflp has over the years organized rallies in berlin with doris ghannam a leader of the bds campaign in germany the dab bank a subsidiary of the french banking giant bnp paribas terminated the bds campaigns account last year after a post investigation when asked by the post last week why the german interior ministry declined to ban the pflp and hezbollah a spokeswoman for the ministry said it does not in general comment on bans european governments permitted the convicted pflp terrorist leila khaled to tour eu countries including germany to promote the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against the jewish state and secure support for the pflp the spanish city council of barcelona paid an ngo to host khaled in may at a literary festival she was involved in the hijacking of israeli and american planes in 1969 and 1970 the japanese red army terrorist group working together with the pflp murdered 26 people and wounded 80 other people in a may terror attack in 1972 at ben gurion airport the pflp also asserted that the israeli state is not a representative of the victims of the holocaustt sic the mks and the german parliamentarians wrote in their august letter to germanys interior minister that hezbollah and the pflp have no place in a society that cherishes freedom democracy and human rights the writers pointed out that both germans and israelis have suffered at the hands of terrorism in recent years and said the ideology of hatred for our way of life has been the same and tragically the results have been the same these two organizations have no place in the civilized world germany and israel stand united in the fight against terrorism and as parliamentarians from both countries we stand united in the call to do everything in our power to eradicate their presence from within our nations the lawmakers said a spokeswoman for the german interior ministry told the post last week that she could not comment on the letter
