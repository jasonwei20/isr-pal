palestinians our boycott of israeli goods faltering campaign had gained steam due to summer war in gaza there has been a decline in the boycott on some items most of the israeli food products are still being boycotted but the main problem is fruits and vegetables plo executive committee member and bds advocate mustafa bargouti told the media line the boycott reached its peak during the war he added an israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the palestinian boycott was having an effect on his country last summer there were some days in specific areas where israeli products were not purchased these cases during operation protective edge were caused and motivated by palestinian business entities that had an economic interest in reducing the volume of imports from israel the official told the media line this could be the reason why bargouti also the president of the palestinian national initiative al mubadara still classifies the boycott as successful however the israeli official denied that the palestinian boycott is having a real effect on the israeli economy the export of israeli products to the palestinian authority areas continues normally he said palestinian economists say it is hard to find accurate statistics on how much israel has been affected by the palestinian boycott but they agree that enthusiasm for boycotting israeli goods is declining on the palestinian street he said items such as water gas oil and electricity were impossible to boycott total imports from israel are 4 5 billion annually he says 3 5b are things like electricity and water that the palestinians do not have the resources to produce themselves leaving 1b of goods that could be boycotted there were really no numbers in the beginning of how many people were boycotting palestinian economist jafar sadaqa told the media line he said the increase in west bank residents using non israeli products was a reaction to what palestinians see as israeli aggression in gaza rather than a nationalistic decision from what i hear or see on the streets the boycott campaign has lessened and regrettably the fear is that this was temporary due to the anger over gaza he said palestinian journalist mohamed abu resh says ramadan was the most serious the boycott has ever been palestinians boycott goods he said as a type of struggle against fighting the presence of the israeli occupation abu resh says he thinks the boycott would have continued with full force had palestinians been consistent in purchasing only goods manufactured in the palestinian territories omar salah who runs abu rami stores in the west bank village of abu dis says his customers are still supporting the boycott although they do not talk about it as much today the israeli product has lost its credibility among the palestinian consumer he told the media line he says palestinians come in seeking alternatives from countries such as turkey saudi arabia and jordan salah better known by his nickname abu rami points to israeli made ketchup bottles sitting on the counter see those i took those off the shelves today because they expired he said he says he orders what the customer wants monthly i used to get 10 boxes of osem pretzels now i just get two boxes he said pointing to the shelf that contains the israeli snack when salam fayyad was the palestinian authority prime minister his government launched a campaign against products from israeli settlements only and not on all israeli products manufactured inside israel that boycott has since been extended at least unofficially to all israeli products without differentiating where they were made salah says its not possible to have a complete boycott of israeli goods as an example he says palestinians have been unable to produce a substitute for sugar free products during the fighting in gaza ramallah resident ibtisam basim would go door to door asking residents to open their refrigerators and kitchen cabinets if she found israeli products she would ask them to use palestinian products we always talked about boycotting but no one really took it seriously until the gaza massacre happened and people really boycotted and were happy to do so basim told the media line four months later she does not go house to house anymore but says her family is supporting the boycott of all israeli products i shouldnt preach that everyone should boycott but i do admit its much harder for people living in the occupied palestinian territories she said its easier for outside countries to do so because they control their own market and because they have alternative sources here there are no substitutes he said abdelkarim also says the momentum of international boycotts is growing last month the leicester city council in england decided to boycott goods that came from israeli factories in the west bank because it condemns the government of israel for its continuing illegal occupation of palestines east jerusalem and the west bank and resolves to boycott any produce originating from illegal israeli settlements other european countries such as france and spain are joining the bds movements while sadaqa says its hard to say how much the boycott affected israel foreign ministry spokesman emmanuel nahshon says israel was never in danger we were not facing a situation where we felt threatened because the whole thing is illegitimate extremist and anti democratic he told the media line but businesses were affected sodastream an israeli company that makes and sells seltzer machines for home use relocated its factory from the west bank to israel due to the numerous calls to ban it it also means that hundreds of palestinian employees could lose their jobs nahshon says the boycott was doomed to fail and never stood a chance calling it useless he says cutting israeli products only incites hatred but abu resh says when a peace deal is struck between palestinians and israelis a boycott will not be necessary there will be two states where the borders will be clear where both sides enjoy importing and exporting and where there will be justice people would be racist to boycott israel then he said
