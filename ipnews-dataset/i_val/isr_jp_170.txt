in 5772 bet on the real israel not the pretend palestine it is far too easy to sour on israel if you only read about it in the newspapers we hear constantly about israels earned isolation and the palestinians progress this week new york times reporters labeled israel a populist ethno religious state like turkey and adrift at sea alone but heres a subversive thought maybe the israelis are winning and the palestinians are losing the state of israel is thriving and livable while the state of palestine only exists in the uns imagination this holiday season with honey ads competing with heartburn remedy ads on israeli radio with jerusalem pierced by the sound of the shofar every morning and serenaded with jewish liturgical poems from the piyut festival nightly im betting on the real

cheap un theatrics to substantive state building and trying to embarrass israel not engage it the palestinians have extended their losing streak and seem no closer to a state on the ground in the

third higher reflecting communal cohesion commitment and optimism zionism has made israel flourish because it is pragmatic humanistic and democratic all traits hamas misreads as weaknesses palestinian political culture by contrast has been extremist nihilist and autocratic yet like that old definition of chutzpah expert at killing parents then demanding the worlds sympathy as orphans zionists have always focused on valuing life empowering individuals and building a state while too many palestinians have been focused on trying to punish them for this in the winter the knesset held its first jewish identity day hosted by the wonderful tzohar rabbis who want israelis to love judaism not fear it emphasizing social values and not religious practices rabbi david stav said our goal is to help
