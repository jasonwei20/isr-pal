the democracy of palestine taken by surprise by the hamas announcement from gaza that hamas agreed to participate in the elections not only in the west bank but also in gaza the initial response in the west bank was almost panic the immediate projections and assessments of a sweeping hamas victory in the west bank led many to predict that the elections would not take place while others offered advice to fatah to find ways of canceling the elections but in doing so to place the blame squarely on hamas if there is one thing clear as day it is that the palestinian people in gaza and the west bank want to have their say on their leadership in a democratic way and the great hope is that municipal elections will lead the way to new national elections for president and parliament the belief or more correctly the hope is that new national elections will lead the way to renewed palestinian unity putting an end to the almost decade old split of the palestinian house between hamas and fatah between the west bank and gaza fatah may also not run direct fatah lists but rather local lists of people who will be supported by fatah in one case in nablus fatah declared its support for a person who in previous elections ran for mayor on behalf of hamas he was not hamas or fatah then nor is he now he is well known and respected local businessman ali yaish there are also those running who in the past were known to be fatah representatives such as former nablus mayor ghassan shaka who was even a member of the plo executive committee on behalf of fatah and has now declared that he is running as an independent even announcing that he is running against fatah this round of elections has also brought unity to the small splintered palestinian left and a joint list of the popular front the palestinian peoples party and fida will run together many local lists will also be formed and supported in more traditional manner especially in villages around the west bank on the basis of extended families and tribes in many families there are supporters of both fatah and hamas perhaps the most well known in israel is the family of long time fatah leader jabril rajoub and his hamas leader brother nayef they originate from the village of dura in the south hebron hills region i dont know if the rajoub family will come together to support one united family tied list but this will happen throughout the periphery of the main cities in the west bank there are many people in fatah and hamas who would prefer to see these elections canceled i have heard proposals of trying to run elections in neighborhoods of east jerusalem knowing in advance that israel will not allow that and thereby having legitimate cause for canceling them there is no doubt that this democratic process poses risks certainly to the palestinian authority on the other hand the democratic process is badly needed and i certainly hope that the best candidates and lists will be elected to serve the people who vote for them palestine needs new leadership and perhaps that new leadership will spring from these elections the author is founder and co chairman of ipcri the israel palestine creative regional initiatives www ipcri org
