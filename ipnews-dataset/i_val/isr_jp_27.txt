un ground zero for antisemitism and incitement on a global scale september has arrived and with it show time at the united nations the 71st session of its general assembly prior to the main event a forum on antisemitism was held last week attended by the un secretary general and the ambassadors of the us canada the eu israel and other countries this forums goal was to draw attention to the worldwide rise of antisemitism which according to israeli ambassador danny danon is at the highest level of our lifetimes and find constructive ways to remedy the problem ironically but not surprisingly the forum failed to address the elephant in the room that the un itself supports and promotes the very antisemitism about which this conference expressed concern unexplored was that the un provides a global megaphone for antisemitism through its accreditation of many non governmental organizations ngos that promote jew hatred condone or justify violence and terrorism and advocate for the destruction of the jewish state a recent report by anne bayefsky and sarah willig of human rights voices documents the travesty the un accredits more than 6 150 ngos to qualify ngos must conform to the un charter by affirming faith in fundamental human rights in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small these ngos are allowed to sponsor un programs speak at un meetings submit statements to un bodies access international press post on un websites and have their messages broadcast globally via un webcasts by providing international exposure and legitimacy to ngos that blatantly violate charter principles the un is complicit in the rise of antisemitism today the bayefsky willig report cites numerous detailed examples of un accredited ngo hate mongering which incites

exist in it historical homeland and holding israel to a higher standard than any other state propagating blood libels against israelis and working to destroy this un member state are clearly anti
