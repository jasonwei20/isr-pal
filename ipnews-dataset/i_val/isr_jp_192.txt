israeli citizens residing in a palestinian state prime minister binyamin netanyahus comment last week that the kerry proposals which we are all still waiting to hear about could entail a situation where jewish residents of some of the west bank settlements would remain as enclaves surrounded on all sides by the palestinian state resulted as would be expected in a heated public debate the israeli right including many members of his own government economy and trade minister naftali bennett foremost among them came out strongly against the idea arguing that the security of these people could not be guaranteed and that the suggestion was no less than a betrayal of the very essence of zionism namely living under jewish and israeli sovereignty the suggestion was condemned as stupid at best and a betrayal of the state at worst equally the palestinian authority came out strongly against the idea arguing that no vestige of the settlements could remain within a palestinian entity since from its perspective settlements represent the very essence of occupation there could not be any agreement without a total evacuation of all settlements located within the palestinian territory netanyahus response was to say that he had specifically made the comment in order to show the americans that such an idea was impossible to implement based on the responses from both the israeli right and the palestinians he would appear to have proved his point given the fact that these two diametric opposites were united in their total opposition to such an idea but already during the past week many commentators have produced maps to show that the existence of national and ethnic exclaves surrounded totally by the territory of another state is not an unknown phenomenon in the world relatively few in number there are cases notably in europe where ethnic groups live under such conditions however these commentators conveniently forget to mention the fact that in almost all of these cases there is a situation of peace and stability and that the exclaves are often seen as curiosities to be visited by tourists rather than painful reminders of yesterdays political tensions and animosity which have yet to be resolved the idea of ethno territorial exclaves for some of the settlements has been proposed as a result of the growing understanding that any israeli government will find it almost impossible to forcefully evacuate the large numbers of settlers who will remain on the wrong side of the new border even if substantial redrawing of the border and land swaps between the two sides take place in an effort to ensure that as many of the settlements particularly the large blocs remain under full israeli sovereignty this is a pragmatic rather than ideological position attempting to evacuate the 60 00080 000 settlers out of a total of over 350 000 will prove to be a task which no israeli government even one of the left will savor assuming that the majority of them will refuse offers of compensation and voluntary evacuation gaza all over again but in much larger numbers with much greater ideological and religious opposition this is after all the very heart of the biblically claimed land of israel and with the benefit of lessons learned from the gaza experience regarding which the more radical elements among the settlers argue they were too soft in their ineffectual response to the forced evacuation in one sense bennetts argument that this is a complete u turn on the very essence of zionism namely that jews should be enabled to live under their own sovereignty is correct but his solution to the problem namely that israel should not enter into any peace agreement and should retain control over all of the west bank is wrong in order to ensure the fulfillment of the zionist dream of living under jewish sovereignty the settlers will have to make that difficult extremely painful decision to relocate to those places where the state of israel the jewish state is indeed sovereign and can continue to protect all of its citizens inside its own territory rather than through a disconnected enclave to which it may not have direct access so is the enclave idea just one of those crazy pipe dreams or does it have any real significance perhaps we will only know when kerry finally outlines the details of the proposal but the very fact that it has been raised by netanyahu and that it has become the subject of such intense and heated political debate makes this almost fictional idea into a potential reality of the future based on recent projects such as those of the shasha center at the hebrew university directed by former mossad chief efraim halevy and hebrew university jerusalem geographer shlomo hasson or the project publicized last week by former peace negotiations expert gilad sher and tel aviv university geographer gideon biger the idea of ethno territorial exclaves and cross citizenship has been analyzed in great detail this is seen as a best of allbad scenarios alternative to the apparent impossibility of resolving the conflict through the demarcation of a single border which cuts neatly between the two sides and their respective populations but israel has a tendency to offer solutions which while they could have been implemented yesterday are no longer feasible the solutions all too often engage with the realities of a yesterday rather than those the present due to the dynamic nature of the change which has taken place during the interim period when the oslo accords were being discussed the idea of a sovereign palestinian state was not yet on the table it was still considered a solution of the radical left and peace groups and had not yet been adopted by yitzhak rabin twenty years later right wing politicians such as ariel sharon and ehud olmert were committed to a palestinian state the idea became more and more acceptable and as the term palestinian state became part of the daily discourse of israeli citizens especially through the media when the idea of land swaps the idea that israel would have to exchange territory for those areas annexed through the redrawing of the border was first suggested at a track ii meeting in rome as far back as 1990 it was thought of as nothing less than fiction but 15 years down the road the concept has become acceptable to the point of almost automatic acceptance as the idea has been discussed time after time again by politicians academic diplomats and political pundits so too with the idea of exclaves netanyahu may be opposed to the idea but by of bringing it into the very center of the current political discourse he has made people sit up and start thinking about the idea when in the past it was never even on the table perhaps this is netanyahus secret strategy start a debate and heated public argument around the idea of territorial exclaves so that the more it is discussed the more it becomes acceptable to people who would never have been prepared even to mention it in the past for most of us it does seem a bit far fetched at this point in time but there is nothing like the familiarity of public discourse to make previously unacceptable ideas acceptable the only question that remains is whether by the time the idea of exclaves becomes acceptable too much time will have passed to make even this seemingly impractical solution impossible to implement as with all past attempts to solve the israel palestine conflict only time will tell and first we must await the american announcement
