palestine in perspective in a recent washington post op ed entitled the palestine romney doesnt know zahi khouri who identified himself as a proud american hardworking businessman job creator faithful christian palestinian took serious umbrage at the unflattering comparison that mitt romney on his recent visit to jerusalem drew between the accomplishments of palestinian society relative to those of israeli society the most charitable way to characterize his attempt to contradict romneys assertion would be to dub it highly partisan indeed whether the result of deliberate distortion or innocent ignorance the entire article was a gross misrepresentation of facts both past and present the weakness of khouris arguments is apparent from the very outset he launches into his endeavor to invalidate the foundations of israels achievement which has placed the country on the cutting edge of human endeavor in science and technology in fields as diverse as medicine telecommunications irrigation and water treatment by trying to belittle its contribution to citrus farming so while khouri is correct that the jaffa orange also known as the shamouti was developed originally by arab farmers his allegation that the prestige of the jaffa brand has been expropriated by the jews seems somewhat inappropriate in his report on immigration land settlement and development in palestine 1930 compiled for the british authorities a document in no way sympathetic to the zionist enterprise sir john hope simpson wrote the following on the topic of the origin of orange cultivation the cultivation of the orange introduced by the arabs before the commencement of jewish settlement has developed to a very great extent in consequence of that settlement there is no doubt that the pitch of perfection to which the technique of plantation and cultivation of the orange and grapefruit have been brought in palestine is due to the scientific methods of the jewish agriculturist clearly then although it seems that citrus growing was originated by the arabs it was the jews who developed it into a major industry so even if khouris claim that jaffa oranges are a palestinian read arab not israeli read jewish trademark has a smattering of historical truth to it we are still left to puzzle over why other arab countries on the eastern mediterranean coast such as lebanon and syria where jaffa oranges are grown never developed the industry in the same way as the israelis did almost comically khouri tries to attribute an absurd misconception to romney of which he then tries to disabuse him he accuses romney of being duped into thinking that oranges falafel and humous staples of palestinian cuisine for generations are israeli products it is difficult to know what is more staggering whether khouri actually believes romneys praise for israels achievement is predicated on his misconception of the true origins of unscrupulously plundered recipes for the preparation of chickpeas falafel and humous or whether he believes that said recipes somehow prove that palestinian accomplishment is comparable to that of israel in among other things computer sciences electronics genetics medical equipment and drugs optics solar energy bio technology aeronautics agriculture and agricultural engineering with all due respect to humous is this what khouri is really raising as the flagship of palestinian enterprise indeed the choice of agriculture seems an injudicious choice of activity by which to try and illustrate israeli palestinian parity sir john hope simpson again on agricultural development in mandatory palestine the condition of the arab fellah farmer is little if at all superior to what it was under the turkish regime no definite policy of agricultural development of the country held by the arabs has been adopted by contrast he reported that the sole agencies which have pursued such a consistent policy have been the jewish ones public and private with this exception agricultural progress of any kind has been haphazard and of small extent or value the jewish settlers have had every advantage that capital science and organization could give them to these and to the energy of the settlers themselves their remarkable progress is due the israeli occupation changed local agriculture profoundly it introduced modern technology including mechanization precision tillage pest control plastic covering of crops for temperature control high yielding varieties postharvest processing of produce marketing and export outlets it also introduced efficient methods of irrigation including sprinkler and especially drip irrigation consequently output increased greatly and farming was transformed from a subsistence enterprise to a commercial industry indeed up to the signing of the oslo agreements the area of land under cultivation by the palestinian arabs more than doubled under israel oppression and the agricultural output increased 12 fold khouri goes on to make the following breathtaking contention ask our fellow arabs in lebanon jordan or elsewhere in the persian gulf region and they will tell you palestinian culture with its premium on education and hard work has been a force for hope development and prosperity premium on education really virtually the entire system of higher education in the west bank and gaza was created post occupation indeed prior to occupation there were no institutions of higher learning of any significance in the west bank or gaza including bir zeit which was originally established in 1924 as a girls school but only attained full university status in the 1970s leaving us to ponder how this professed palestinian premium on education expressed itself it describes the fierce discrimination dubbed by one arab journalist as apartheid that has left the palestinians in dire poverty and resulted in crushing unemployment over 60 of the workforce he probably didnt spot the determination of the immigration judge cited in ahmed v ashcroft third circuit us appeals court which specified palestinians in saudi arabia are relegated to officially sanctioned second class status incorporated into the legal and social structure of saudi arabia in it youssef unabashedly declared that the palestinians fellow arabs were deliberately prohibiting them from attaining the citizenship they desired and keeping them in very bad conditions read penury and privation so as to to preserve their palestinian identity so it would seem that the palestinians fellow arabs express their view of the palestinians as a force for hope and prosperity by holding them in a state of despair and destitution go figure as a faithful christian he seems curiously unaware of or unconcerned by the ravages his co religionists have been forced to endure under palestinian culture but such harassment has not been confined to the hamas dominated gaza indeed shortly after the commencement of the palestinian authoritys rule the times of london tensions darken festive mood in bethlehem december 22 1997 wrote of the dire predicament of the christians under that regime life in bethlehem has become insufferable for many members of the dwindling christian minorities increasing muslim christian tensions have left some christians reluctant to celebrate christmas in the town at the heart of the story of christs birth the paper cited reports that christian cemeteries have been destroyed monasteries broken into and their telephone lines disconnected it conveyed the grave concern expressed by dr george carey then archbishop of canterbury who said after a visit to the holy land in 1993 my fear is that in 15 years jerusalem and bethlehem once centres of a strong christian presence might become a kind of walt disney christian theme park khouris penchant for self aggrandizement exposes his lack of perception and proportion he boasts i returned to palestine in 1993 to launch the first coca cola bottling plant in the west bank it was granted a best country bottling operation award in may by coca cola a testament to my colleagues ingenuity and determination while khouri should be commended on his success a plant for topping up bottles of foreign sourced soft drink however well run is with all due respect hardly a staggering industrial achievement in the second decade of the 21st century not really on the cusp of creative advancement is khouri really suggesting it is somehow indicative of the comparable energy and enterprise that launched leading industrial giants such as teva elbit checkpoint israel aerospace industries to name but a few examples of israeli entrepreneurship there are of course refined erudite and capable palestinians and khouri is in all likelihood one of them but sadly these manifestations of individual competence and acumen do not seem to translate into societal success either within the palestinian world or in the wider arab world of which they claim they are part it is of course not immediately obvious how one could compile a compelling case to attribute such dismal culture wide under achievement to israels imposed hindrances khouris venom verges on the ludicrous when he snipes spitefully israel did not make the desert bloom after all even the briefest visit to the inhospitably arid regions of the arava and negev would suffice to repudiate khouris mendacious malice it would reveal not only tens of thousands of hectares of extensive dry farming producing tens of thousands of metric tons of grain but also modern cutting edge greenhouses and the flourishing innovatively irrigated orchards that yield impressive quantities of some of worlds finest horticulture produce most for export markets in the west deserts mr khouri dont come much more blooming than that but resolutely impervious to readily visible fact khouri brings the non sequitur to rarely attained levels when he appears inexplicably to attribute the astounding and globally acknowledged success of israeli agriculture to a deal struck with the british viceroys of mandate palestine almost seven decades ago grudgingly khouri admits that israelis far outdo palestinians in net wealth in fact romneys estimates of the disparity were too conservative israels per capita gross domestic product is roughly 32 000 to the palestinians 1 500 he goes on to observe correctly that remarkably that 1 500 figure is roughly half of what palestinians claimed in 1993 when the oslo accords were signed but then somewhat discordantly as a proud american gripes that the us sponsored peace process has made us poorer this of course is a baseless grievance that flies in the face of facts for in fact the us had no hand in brokering the oslo deal which was the unfortunate product of direct israeli palestinian negotiations although later it did contribute generously to palestinian coffers in a vain effort to help it succeed somehow making palestinians poorer so while it is indeed true that palestinians did fare far better under israeli occupation than under their own corrupt cruel and less than competent regime this is attributable exclusively to their own deeds and misdeeds to what they did and to what they did not do but rather than recognize palestinian responsibility for the palestinians plight khouri typically adopts the well known palestinian stratagem of blaming everyone and anyone the british the us the israelis except themselves for their own unenviable plight one of the most galling allegations that khouri hurls is that palestinians are being deprived of water by israel on the contrary the palestinians hydrological situation has improved beyond all recognition under israeli administration not only in absolute terms compared to initial pre occupation conditions but in relative terms compared to that of israelis whether one focuses on overall consumption of fresh water per capita consumption of fresh water consumption of fresh water relative to israelis accessibility of running water to households the area under agricultural cultivation or the size of the agricultural product the conditions for the palestinians were dramatically enhanced by israeli rule moreover from 1967 to the years just before oslo palestinian household consumption of water rose precipitously by almost 600 significantly higher than the 230 rise in israel similarly water conveyance to households also increased impressively whereas in 1967 only 10 of the west bank arab population was connected to a running water system the figure today stands at 95 so much for discriminatory deprivation as mentioned palestinian agricultural performance improved spectacularly as well both in terms of area cultivated and quantities produced even though water allocations were not increased significantly in recent years israeli farmers have had their freshwater allocations slashed by 50 and more khouri complains that i n the west bank for example israeli settlers consume on average 4 3 times the amount of water as palestinians however he fails to mention that israel conveys more water from inside the pre 1967 borders into the west bank than the total consumption of the entire jewish population in the settlements across the green line in other words there is a net inflow of water from pre 1967 israel to the palestinians which more than compensates for the settlers sorely maligned lawns and swimming pools indeed while claims that per capita consumption of water by israelis is much higher than that of the palestinian population are true this is principally a result of differences in demand not supply because of differences in lifestyles clearly the fact that a millionaire in an opulent penthouse in manhattan will use far less water than an equally affluent owner of a sprawling estate in bel air is not a matter of discriminatory deprivation significantly different rates of consumption are found between the jewish and arab populations within pre 1967 israel and between different socio economic groups within the jewish population without anyone raising the claim that this is the result of purposeful deprivation interestingly per capita consumption in the frequently vilified settlement of kiryat arba is 25 lower than in the beduin city of rahat and 90 lower than in up market savyon what perverse discrimination does that indicate according to khouri palestinian development of all kinds is severely hindered by the israeli occupation in fact it soared under israeli administration and wilted under palestinian rule he continues yet palestinians have not given up palestine has one of the highest literacy rates in the arab world forgetting to note that is was under israeli administration that literacy rose precipitously he claims that our youth continue to graduate from our universities but fails to mention that none of these existed prior to 1967 he crows that palestinians are opening businesses and gaining skills our private sector innovates and grows when in fact despite massive international aid among the highest per capita in the world the palestinian economy is still unsustainable comprised mainly of a bloated public sector and a minuscule private one generating a gdp dramatically lower than disposable income he concludes his duplicitous diatribe with the following words if romney had any historical perspective he would dispose of his racist judgments about palestinian culture and instead imagine our potential without israels imposed hindrances apart from the fact that romney of course never made any reference to race but rather to culture there is really no need for him to imagine how a palestinian dominant society would fare without israels imposed hindrances all he needs to do is look at jordan where the palestinians comprise a clear majority and at the performance of the jordanian economy which is manifestly unencumbered by israels imposed hindrances what he would find is a gdp per capita barely one eighth that of israels hardly something that helps khouri make his case it does however help romney make his martin sherman www martinsherman net is the founder and executive
