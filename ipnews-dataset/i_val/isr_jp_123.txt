 this week in palestine looking for a unique holiday destination something exotic inexpensive close to home and not yet inundated by israelis ive discovered just the spot its called palestine i got up close by joining a tour run by ir amim an ngo that seeks to render jerusalem a more viable and equitable city for the israelis and palestinians who share it it consisted of a four hour whirlwind trip through our own backyard traveling barely 30 minutes in any direction from the citys center and still managing to get to places where none of our group of 30 had ever been given that a third of the municipalitys residents dwell in these areas its hard to escape the reality that we live in a city already divided take a look jerusalem today numbers 780 000 inhabitants approximately 280 000 of them or 35 percent are palestinians only a handful are christian of the remainder who are jews 60 of the children are enrolled in haredi schools do the math the city is home to more palestinians than zionists and their numerical advantage becomes more pronounced with each passing year one more statistic to make the point since the city was unified in 1967 the arab population has increased by almost 300 the jewish population by less than half of that so why dont we feel the palestinian presence in the city council asks one of my fellow travelers the answer is simple they dont vote not because they arent entitled to but because they choose not to following the six day war east jerusalem arabs were given the prerogative of claiming israeli citizenship or permanent resident status more than 99 opted for the latter that gives them the right to vote and run for office in municipal elections but their leadership has consistently insisted that they boycott the polls arguing that participating in them would be tantamount to granting legitimacy to israels sovereignty as a consequence of this policy combined with israeli short sightedness arab sectors of the city receive less than 10 of the municipal budget surely there are different ways of presenting these statistics and a multiplicity of imaginative ways in which to assign the blame but the bottom line is that muslim areas are considerably underdeveloped relative to the jewish neighborhoods and for many the resulting hardships have been exacerbated by the eight meter high concrete barrier that meanders along the hills on jerusalems outskirts one of the places from which the impact of this wall can be seen most clearly is at the southern edge of gilo from there one has an unobstructed view of the village of walaja the town of beit jala and the city of bethlehem on second thought unobstructed is perhaps not the best choice of words what you see from here is most definitely not what you see from there approximately one third of walaja extends over jerusalems municipal boundary were the wall to be built along that border the village residents would be cut off from one another and from their lands citing security considerations the defense ministry planned to completely encircle the village within the wall the residents prefer to be on its far side even though that would mean forgoing easy access to jerusalem the entire matter too complex to expound upon here is currently under consideration by the high court of justice when i walked the streets of beit jala for the first time writes xavier abu eid an adviser to the plo negotiating team my life changed within seconds i was a young boy inspired by the memories of judeh my grandfather from chile where we used to live he told me of the sweetest apricots the biggest figs the tastiest olives and the best olive oil i would never trade watching a sunset from among our olive trees for being in any other spot in this world nor would i consider anything ive experienced in chile as pleasant as a walk along the upper edge of town when he takes that walk however the jewish neighborhood he sees is more than an eyesore on an otherwise pastoral landscape it is the very symbol of jewish expansionism abu eid continues but this fairy tale that diaspora palestinians make of our hometowns is sadly contrasted with the reality of the israeli occupation that has turned every single aspect of our lives into an open wound that only freedom will heal across the wadi christmas celebrations will soon be in full swing with midnight mass in the church of the nativity broadcast to every corner of the world but the palestinian authority wants to keep bethlehem in the limelight for the rest of the year as well in the december issue of the tourist magazine this week in palestine in which the beit jala story also appears there are several articles about the city the most engaging carries a headline referring to the birthplace of jesus as an icon of fashion the paris of palestine and extols the beauty and style of bethlemite women a feast for the eyes of any visitor to this glorious town it continues with a description of the veil that was worn to cover her head when a woman left her house bemoans the departure from that custom and expresses the hope that the article will serve not only to bring back to the readers imagination the beauty of the traditional dress but also to encourage designers to reintroduce this beauty into the modern dresses of bethlehem paris be warned i picked up my copy of this week in palestine at east jerusalems american colony hotel which my wife and i decided was a fitting setting in which to digest all we had experienced throughout the morning i also took a copy of visit palestine and a complimentary map of israel the west bank gaza jerusalem and old city with the areas under pa control clearly delineated in the genteel environment of this lush garden restaurant with its sophisticated menu polite maitre d and professional waiters even the call of the muezzin sounded romantic lulling us into imagining that peace might be just around the corner if only we could learn to listen to one another in fact it was so calm and peaceful that one could almost be tempted into ignoring the pa sanctioned study denying any connection between the western wall and the temple the objectivity of the report could hardly be challenged if approved by pa president mahmoud abbas whose doctoral thesis asserted that the holocaust claimed the lives of only 890 000 jews and was in any case the result of premeditated collaboration between nazi and zionist leaders in this atmosphere one might even be tempted into disregarding hamas prime minister ismail haniyehs confirmation that the inferno on the carmel was an expression of gods anger with israel a punishment from allah after all his take on things was remarkably similar to that of shas mentor ovadia yosef who blamed the conflagration on our own lax standards of shabbat observance yes one could almost be tempted but not quite there is after all a line distinguishing competing narratives from blatant revisionism until those with whom we need to make peace are prepared to respect that line it is going to be impossible to draw any on a map that would resolve our conflict the wall now enveloping jerusalem however problematic is the least of the barriers separating us thats why i recommend a visit to palestine these observations are not about recognizing statehood but reality besides its always good to get to know ones neighbors the writer is vice chairman of the world zionist organization and a member of the jewish agency executive the opinions expressed in this column are his own keep dreaming on a recent group trip traveling barely 30 minutes in any direction from the center of jerusalem we managed to get to places where none of us had ever been
