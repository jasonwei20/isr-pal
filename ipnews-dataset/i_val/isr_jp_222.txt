murray greenfield a humble israeli hero after a chat over coffee on a friday morning murray greenfield 88 walks me to a photograph in the lounge of his comfortable ramat aviv home it is a picture of prime minister david ben gurion addressing the inaugural dinner of the association of americans and canadians in israel on march 7 1961 with a young murray greenfield by his side then the american born greenfield does what he arguably does best he tells a story when i first became the executive director of aaci we were unknown as an organization he said so i said were going to have a big dinner and im going to get ben gurion to come everyone said but we dont have any money i said dont worry so i went to the prime ministers office to see yitzhak navon and i said to him were going to have an annual dinner at the sheraton hotel which was a new hotel in tel aviv and he said i cant guarantee it weve got a lot going on he said what do you want from me and i said all i want from you is a letter noting that the date has been put on the prime ministers calendar thats all i need so i told everybody ben gurion is coming knowing full well that he may not show up and we sold tickets and made money it was the first time aaci made some money you know greenfield recalls and there it was at the new sheraton hotel and guess what he shows up and me im happy well he gets up and he started to talk calling on american jews to make aliya and his wife she says oy again hes talking about aliya that was the picture nobody believed he would show up and i had to be straight faced and say what are you talking about hes gonna come i got a letter but he came and it was a wonderful evening on top of everything the sheraton hotel had a bar and they figured people would drink liquor so they gave me a very cheap price for the evening but laughing of course nobody bought any liquor after the dinner the guy from the hotel says to me you guys dont drink and i said no we only drink kiddush wine and he says boy did i lose on that dinner and i say you didnt lose what are you talking about you made a lot the prime minister came the story is classic greenfield murray is a marvelous story teller and superb salesman but his modesty and humor hide a life long devotion to the state of israel in a myriad of ways including the rescue by sea of jews who survived the holocaust helping immigrants from north america as a founding member of aaci and playing a leading role in the aliya of ethiopian jewry as head of aaci he is credited with establishing the first loan funds a mortgage fund and a variety of housing projects in jerusalem tel aviv and on kibbutzim one of the biggest problems for aliya is the lack of housing which i fought for during my term as executive director of aaci he says this is a problem that were still facing today he also accomplished a range of countless other achievements on the way from running gift shops to serving as an investment counselor with the palestinian economic corporation exporting israeli art to new york from his tel aviv based israel art gallery and in 1981 establishing the jerusalem based gefen publishing house israels top english language book publisher together with his wife hana lustig a czech born holocaust survivor greenfield was born and grew up in a middle class jewish family in new york city speaking english and yiddish during world war ii he served in the merchant marines and by late 1946 someone told him about aliyah bet or illegal immigration as the british termed the jews who trying to enter israel after surviving the holocaust greenfield became one of 250 american volunteers who sailed on so called rust buckets vessels that were not made for long journeys between 1946 and 1948 rescuing more than a third of holocaust survivors from ports in europe to cyprus tel aviv and haifa greenfield says he was motivated by ben gurion to write the book the prime minister confessed to him that he knew nothing about the jewish americans who had rescued european jews on ships after the holocaust and it should be documented for posterity we created the jewish state with the help of these ships greenfield says of the 70 000 odd jews who were brought to palestine after world war ii and before the state over 50 percent came on american ships sailed by some 250 young men who were volunteers like myself greenfield believes that without the united nations partition plan for palestine which became un general assembly resolution 181 the operation could never have been completed we had to win the war of independence otherwise where would we be but that was the next stage because if the british had been told by the united nations to keep palestine we couldnt have won any war he says im sure when i look back at it all the british did not believe the united nations would vote in favor of two states but once the british lost because theyre law abiding people they gave up and so i tell people that although i didnt realize it at the time we helped establish the jewish state i ask greenfield when it actually hit him that he might have played a key role in the establishment of israel not one to toot his own horn he pauses for a minute and tells me it was probably during one of his early speaking tours to the us where he was dispatched to sell israel encourage investment in the new state and encourage people to make aliya herbert friedman a reform rabbi in cleveland who later became head of the united jewish appeal turned to greenfield while introducing him in denver and said i as a chaplain in the american army salute you for what you did you were a part of the founding of the state of israel before he said that i think i was first trying to be a hero by saving holocaust survivors and later selling a product israel that i didnt really understand at the time greenfield said but afterwards i thought to myself gee i better look into that maybe i had mazel but that was really the root of my zionism together he and hana created the czech torah scrolls project www czechtorah org as well as educational programs in the czech republic and at the terezin ghetto museum to inform young and old about the horrors of the holocaust in 1973 murray and hana published a book titled how to be an oleh or things the jewish agency never told you hana also wrote fragments of memory which has been published in six languages greenfield who will be 89 on june 23 is still very active regularly talking to groups of students soldiers business people and tourists traveling abroad and volunteering for friends of the diaspora museum zoa house the dick siegel marketing fund at tel aviv university and bahalachin the ethiopian jews cultural center asked what message he conveys when he speaks to israeli and jewish groups from around the world greenfield says i say were winners and its because of you but weve got to stand up you must be ready to stand up when i meet with groups of college students from america i tell them to wear leather gloves so that when they throw tear gas at you you are ready to fight when i speak to kids i say you know when i came here i had a public telephone that cost three dollars a minute to call america todays its practically free i had a typewriter you dont know what a typewriter is you got these fancy computers in your hands we worked with primitive things to fight for israel you have to get up and use these sophisticated things to fight for israel everyone should know for example what israeli goods to buy to counter this boycott movement against us thats your job again greenfield tells a story to illustrate his point when i was in america i was invited to havdala at someones home so i go and there are about 50 families there and i look on the table and i say wheres the israeli wine the host responded that he had israeli wine but he had decided not to offer it to his guests greenfield replied but thats your job you come and visit us but you have got to buy and show off israeli goods because youre part and parcel of our war im not so good at it greenfield added but im working on it i feel i can still do something about improving israeli exports and fighting this bds business for me its b i g buy israel goods thats it thats what we can do this is tachlis think big the new york born octogenarian who helped create the jewish state still thinks big independence day supplement
