facebook challenge an israeli palestinian accord what can israelis and palestinians agree on everything or nothing i was asked to address this question by the moderator of a facebook forum devoted to discussing middle east peace ive joined a number of such groups in recent weeks in an effort to help promote my new book broken spring its full of lessons and one of them egypt israel relations can be a model for answering the question my brief experience with most of the facebook groups has been disappointing all of them have peace in their titles but the overall tone of the posts with some notable exceptions is extremism and hate each event in the world that is related even tangentially to the israel palestinian conflict becomes just the latest club with which to bash the other side the targeted side fires back in kind preconceived notions are reinforced sometimes someone usually me appeals for a modicum of civility heres one of mine dont you people ever get tired of going over and over the same old ground with no intention of persuading anybody about anything years ago sensible israelis and palestinians agreed on the geneva initiative which lays out in great detail the solution to the israel palestinian conflict except for refugees treaty annexes and details www geneva accord org why dont we all take a break from bashing each other and spend a few hours reading that the ideologues and extremists on both sides those who truly believe that israel is a cancer that must be removed that everything israel does is aimed at oppressing the palestinians that israel intentionally and happily kills palestinian babies or those who believe that all palestinians are terrorists that all of them believe jews should be massacred at every opportunity that there is no such thing as a palestinian or palestine that all of them should be expelled to jordan or the moon or wherever those people make up the nothing part of the equation i got into a facebook discussion with a couple of israel bashers who assumed i was a mouthpiece for the hated zionists i explained that indeed i was an israeli but that i was also a journalist analyst author who has covered the conflict hands on for four decades and is trying to provide some background and context the reply was that this person had also covered the conflict for decades though hed never been within 7 000 km of the region i admit i laughed there are issues and narratives that will never be reconciled who did what to whom when why which side has suffered more who has historical religious security rights to which sliver of land on that basis nothing will ever be achieved president shimon peres says peace can be made by looking forward not backward peres isnt right about everything but hes right about that lets examine where that leads israelis are sitting on the edge of their collective chair waiting for egypt to abrogate the 1979 peace treaty that has revolutionized the middle east far more than any accord between israel and the palestinians ever could israelis were certain that the day after the muslim brotherhood took power in cairo the treaty would be canceled it wasnt they assume the new military rulers are just as anti israel in their own way noting the frequent israel bashing in the egyptian press and anti semitic statements by officials and thinkers and that cancellation is just a matter of time it hasnt happened it wont the reason is that israel and egypt both have vital common interests at stake interests that require that the peace treaty remain in force and more that cooperation increase thats all in the book what if we examine the interests of israelis and palestinians and see where that leads us if it is in the interest of israel to oppress the palestinians annex their territories and claim ownership of the west bank and if it is in the interest of the palestinians to claim israeli territory or try to flood it with millions of palestinians then we can stop right here if it is in the interest of both sides to set up two states living side by side then its doable notice i didnt say side by side in peace that might come later and its secondary anyway peaceful warm relations develop over time or they dont israel and egypt arent particularly friendly but they co operate in many ways most of which are not public good enough neither side should be asked to forget history each side can learn lessons from its history be proud of parts of it and less proud of other parts but no one should be enslaved by history instead if the principle of acting according to interests is accepted then its a matter of hammering out terms that both sides can live with as opposed to what both sides believe is theirs by right the benefits are obvious even more than the bilateral benefits of the egypt israel treaty ruling over your own people and not the other side economic stimulation prosperity and redirection of resources from conflict to cooperation after a certain run in period with the requisite safety mechanisms security challenges would fade as they have between egypt and israel because of the interests listed above did you know that there is still a multinational force in egypts sinai desert charged with observing the behavior of the two sides and pointing out violations its pretty much unemployed and forgotten few predicted that kind of calm the day after the peace treaty was signed in 1979 for israel an agreement based on such interests means uprooting as few israelis as possible from west bank settlements but many palestinians would get a contiguous sensible block of territory in the west bank and a corridor to link it to gaza this is achievable with swaps of territory it means sharing jerusalem if neither side is threatening the other theres no reason to physically divide the city but after decades of bloody conflict lets be realistic it will be divided at least at the beginning arab neighborhoods will be in palestine jewish neighborhoods will be in israel and the religions will administer their holy sites it means a reasonable solution for refugees there are not seven million palestinian refugees as some claim that would be an unrealistic tenfold natural increase in 60 years no population has ever mushroomed like that for example the jewish people are not even back to the numbers they had before the holocaust whatever the actual numbers some compensation needs to be worked out some refugees need to return to israel symbolically these are just details once its a matter of interests other issues could be resolved just as quickly they already have been worked out in the detailed and sensible geneva initiative one central part of this is its a package deal if we keep bringing individual issues to the fore one by one then of course each side must reject each demand of the other side in turn a package deal would include a statement in which israel acknowledges the suffering of the palestinians and their right to a state and palestinians acknowledge the suffering of the jews and their right to a state and so on down the list both sides get what they need can this be done in theory of course it can the geneva initiative people did it already can israeli and palestinian leaders do this themselves not likely they cower before their own extremists and are tied to their own ideology ive written for years that a solution will have to be imposed from the outside its a pity since the elements are all there and everyone knows what they are the price of not reaching an agreement is more stalemate more suffering more wasted resources time is not on anyones side and before the bashers out there start in on me for this article let me say this i welcome criticism of anything everything i write thats one of the ways i learn but from this day forward i will ignore the posts of the ideologues and extremists this issue is too important for those of us who actually live here because the choice is clear everything or nothing the author a foreign correspondent has covered the middle east since 1972 his book broken spring is from gefen publishing house of jerusalem
