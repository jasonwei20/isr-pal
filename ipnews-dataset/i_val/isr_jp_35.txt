at the risk of seeming to be a supporter of donald trump which i am not i object most strongly to douglas bloomfields article gop reaps what it sows december 10 suggesting that trump is a nazi statements like its only a matter of time before his supporters begin showing up at rallies wearing brown shirts are simply deplorable at his worst trump has called for not allowing muslims into the us he has not called for any actions to be taken against muslims in the country facile and slipshod use of the nazi analogy trivializes the evil actually done by true nazis and is insulting to the memory of those who suffered so greatly under nazi rule both bloomfield and the post should be ashamed of themselves englewood new jersey donald trump announces that muslims should not be allowed in to the united states the israeli left cries gevalt and demands that netanyahu refuse to meet with trump abu mazen announces that jews must not be allowed into palestine the israeli left demands that netanyahu meet with abu mazen jews are forbidden by law from being citizens of jordan and saudi arabia and the world remains silent what would these same good folks say if abu mazen or king abdullah were to announce that blacks and christians cannot be citizens in their lands with relation to your report on the statement of donald trump regarding muslims and the british reaction thereto 150 000 britons petition to ban trump from uk december 10 one can imagine the brief interchange between the parties in an imaginary stand off british mr trump are you inferring that all muslims are terrorists trump no only that all terrorists are muslims on wednesday in florida police charged a 15 year old boy for shooting and murdering rabbi joseph raskin a year ago while walking to synagogue they are charging the youth with first degree murder and trying him as an adult we in israel need to follow this example a child who does an adult crime needs to be charged as an adult no question do the crime do the time as i read your story on the natural gas outline netanyahu gas outline is critical to energy security december 9 the age old battle between the capitalist forces of israels business sector start up nation on the one hand and the socialist forces of the political camp the government is responsible for the economic well being of every citizen on the other were quite pronounced those opposed to the netanyahu plan give new meaning to risk reward you take the risk the state will take the reward the noble energy group invested risked in the order of 1 billion in exploration question how much did the state invest answer zero but to the political left this fact has no bearing on the need for the state to be entitled to an outsized portion of the profits marx and lenin are smiling in their graves the criticism by chief rabbi lau of naftali bennett is totally unacceptable lau criticized bennett for visit in conservative school in us december 10 the ministers duties are to be close to and to advise all sections of jews orthodox conservative and reform bennett was totally correct in what he did laus criticism is another example of the lack of understanding by the chief rabbinate of what is needed in our communities a large portion of todays jews feel that the chief rabbinate is not fulfilling a needed function laus comment that orthodoxy was the future of judaism is an example of his negative attitude and only succeeds in alienation by non orthodox jews saudis and hashemites in her letter european penchant dec 9 naomi sandler states the european powers lopped off most of palestine and turned it over to a saudi aristocrat creating the hashemite kingdom of jordan in fact the saudis and the hashemites were enemies the saudis came from the western desert region of arabia the nejd and conquered mecca from the hashemite ruler sharif hussein and established saudi arabia in 1932 the british honored their commitments to hussein after world war i by giving transjordan and iraq to his two sons king faisal ii of iraq was overthrown in 1958 leaving jordan as the only remaining hashemite kingdom there is certainly some dispute over whether or not the arabs were promised any rights in palestine according to the mcmahon letters which were exchanged between sir henry mcmahon the british high commissioner to egypt and sharif hussein in 1918 palestine was never explicitly mentioned and would have contradicted the prior british commitment to establish a jewish homeland in palestine according to the balfour declaration of 1917 what a lovely letter from
