 Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has warned of what he calls harsh consequences if the Palestinian Authority goes ahead with its plan to seek UN membership as an independent state.  Lieberman, who is known for his extremist anti-Palestinian stance, however, failed to mention what the threatened consequences might be.  "The moment has not yet come to give details of what will happen," the hardline Israeli foreign minister said adding that "What I can say with the greatest confidence is that from the moment they pass a unilateral decision there will be harsh and grave consequences."  The US state department has also said that Washington will fight to what it called a bitter end to thwart the move by the Palestinian Authority.  The US and Israeli threats come as most countries including some veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council have voiced their support for the Palestinian bid.  However, if effort is blocked at the UNSC, the Palestinians say they will turn to the General Assembly, where they are expected to easily win the votes to upgrade representation from observer body to non-member state.  The 66th UN General Assembly, due to open on 20 September, will vote on a Palestinian state.  Taking on Turkey: Israel’s ‘Dangerous’ Game PLO Official Voices Criticism of UN Membership Plan
