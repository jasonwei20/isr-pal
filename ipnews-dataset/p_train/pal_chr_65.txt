 Israel has demolished or sealed 48 Palestinian homes in the Occupied West Bank and Jerusalem since October 2015, The Abdullah Hourani Center for Studies and Documentation said in a report. The Center indicated that 43 homes were demolished and five sealed shut since the start of the Jerusalem Intifada, uprising in the the Occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. Meanwhile, on Thursday, many Arab citizens of Israel gathered in the al-Tira town, 7 kilometers south of Haifa, and prevented the Israeli police from demolishing another Palestinian home, a Jerusalem-based news website tweeted. Israeli authorities often demolish Palestinian homes under the pretense of them being built without licence. In Qalandia, a village located between Ramallah and Occupied east Jerusalem, Israeli authorities continue to demolish Palestinian homes, a video released by Quds Press showed. The Center said the demolitions and sealing of homes are part of Israel’s collective punishment policy against the Palestinian civilians who have been living under a 51-year-long military occupation. “This type of forceful evacuation of protected persons constitutes a severe violation of international humanitarian law.” Israeli Forces Injure Five Palestinians near Gaza Fence Kushner Discusses ‘Deal of the Century’, Gaza Siege with Netanyahu (VIDEOS)
