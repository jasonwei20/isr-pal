 Israeli police and Shin Bet, Israel’s internal intelligence agency, forces raided several neighborhoods in occupied East Jerusalem overnight between Monday and Tuesday, storming and ransacking Palestinian homes that police accused of being financially supported by the Hamas movement. Israeli police spokeswoman Luba al-Samri said in a statement that the raids were carried out after “intensive investigations” by Israeli police and intelligence officials that indicated that Jerusalemite families of “terrorists” were receiving money and funding from the Hamas movement “to reward them for the bloody and massive terrorist attacks their children have carried out.” Seven homes were ransacked and inspected, while Israeli forces seized approximately 100,000 shekels ($27,092) worth of money in Israeli and foreign currencies, in addition to jewelry and a private car. All properties and money were confiscated, according to al-Samri. The targeting of family members of Palestinians accused of carrying out attacks against Israelis – particularly those believed to be affiliated with Hamas – has been a long-employed tactic of Israeli forces, with right groups denouncing the practice as “collective punishment.” Palestinians affiliated with Hamas, which Israel and the United States have classified as a terrorist organization, are routinely subjected to raids and detentions in what rights groups say is part of an ongoing Israeli effort to suppress Palestinian political processes – and, as a result, Palestinian political sovereignty and self-determination.
