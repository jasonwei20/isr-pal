palestinians meet to rethink calls for israel s destruction the palestine national council the palestinian parliament in exile whose roster of members reads like a who s who of israel s old enemies convened today in gaza to hear yasir arafat say that the time had come to formally take israel s destruction off the palestinian agenda participants here said mr arafat faces some hard bargaining over the next three days his mission is to convince the members many of them hard core radicals to make a conciliatory gesture toward israel at a time when israeli attacks have killed scores of civilians in lebanon and while gaza is in its seventh week of harsh israeli restrictions imposed after a series of suicide bombings in israel some of the biggest names of the palestinian resistance like george habash of the popular front for the liberation of palestine and nayef hawatmeh of the democratic front for the liberation of palestine declined to come to the meeting which has been planned for several weeks still those members who did accept israel s offer of safe passage included several palestinians whose names continue to inspire rage among israelis among the estimated 500 delegates gathered in gaza s modern cultural center was mohammed abbas a k a abu abbas who is wanted in the united states for leading the group that hijacked the achille lauro in 1985 and killed a disabled american passenger there was also mohammed daoud odeh who as abu daoud is held accountable by israel for the massacre of olympic athletes in munich in 1972 though he has denied any role these men and all other members of the palestine national council were granted permission by prime minister shimon peres to enter israel to attend the meeting mr peres s offer was intended to insure that the palestinians would formally abandon the calls for israel s destruction enshrined in the covenant adopted by the palestine liberation organization at its inception in 1964 under the israeli palestinian accord signed in september 1994 mr arafat pledged by early may to purge the document of articles like no 15 which declares it a duty to repulse the zionist imperialist invasion from the great arab homeland and to purge the zionist presence from palestine in his impassioned opening speech mr arafat called on the council not to give israel an excuse to further delay the establishment of the palestinian homeland i call on the council to amend all the articles which contradict the peace of the brave which we signed and to authorize the legal committee to draft a charter which will take into account new developments mr arafat said one inch of palestinian land and our presence on the land of palestine is more dear than words on paper outside the hall refusing to participate and distributing militant leaflets against the peace agreements with israel was leila khaled who became a revolutionary icon of the 1970 s after participating in the hijackings of two airplanes miss khaled accepted the offer of a safe return but joined in a decision of the popular front to send only a symbolic delegation to the session the groups represented at the gathering were as steeped in intrigue and violence as they were redundant in their names besides mr habash s popular front and mr hawatmeh s democratic front which sent only symbolic delegations there were mr abu abbas s palestinian liberation front the palestinian peoples party the palestinian democratic union the arab liberation front the palestinian popular struggle front and of course mr arafat s fatah the most notable absence was that of the damascus based popular front for the liberation of palestine general command the two militant islamic groups in gaza and the west bank hamas and islamic jihad both targets of the israeli and palestinian crackdown are not members of the council but hamas distributed an appeal to council members to avoid amending the covenant until its members were released from prison participants agreed that mr arafat still faced a tough battle to amend the covenant though there were few members who saw any importance in the document which was long ago rendered obsolete first by developments and later by declarations many chafed at changing it under israeli pressure though only mr arafat spoke at the opening session the delegates made clear their anti israeli sentiments when they marked the arrival of mr abu abbas with a long ovation and when they interrupted mr arafat s speech to applaud his references to iraq and lebanon one proposal made by delegates was to simply scrap the old covenant and in its stead to affirm a declaration of independence that the council adopted in 1988 that declaration recognized the existence of a jewish state and at the same time proclaimed a palestinian state with its capital jerusalem delegates said israel opposed that option both because israelis would find the proclamation provocative and because mr peres wanted the offensive articles in the old covenant specifically rejected in the end participants agreed that mr arafat would probably get his way in his agreement with the israelis he pledged that he would amend the covenant within two months after the new palestinian legislative council is seated the current term expires on may 2 shortly thereafter israel and the palestinians are required by the agreement to start negotiations on a final peace settlement the very fact of gathering so disparate a collection of palestinian exiles was already a victory for the p l o leader by convincing a majority of the old council members to enter gaza he also won their tacit recognition of his authority it also marked a symbolic joining of the external and internal palestinian political movements since the members of the internal legislative council that was elected in january automatically gained a place on the national council which until now has been made up of palestinians living abroad though the exact division of powers between the two is likely to be contested in the future mr arafat made clear that the palestinian diaspora is still an integral part of the palestinian movement above all the meeting represented the many ironies and contradictions that are the middle east here was israel locked in vicious battle to destroy hamas at home and hezbollah in lebanon allowing scores of its worst enemies to enter the country untouched and here were men and women who had dedicated their entire lives to the destruction of israel gathering under israeli protection to assure israelis that they no longer meant it graphic photo at a meeting of the palestine national council yesterday soha arafat wife of yasir arafat chatted with mohammed abbas also known as abu abbas he led
