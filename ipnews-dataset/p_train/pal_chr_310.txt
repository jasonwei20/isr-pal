 Acting Palestinian Authority Chief Mahmud Abbas has blasted the Israeli move for an internal investigation of its deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid convoy.  Abbas said Monday that Israel’s planned internal committee could not meet the demands of the UN Security Council.  "The proposition made today (by Israel) for the inquiry committee does not correspond to the request of the Security Council," he was quoted as saying by AFP.  He made the remarks after Israel’s cabinet backed its own proposed internal committee to probe the May 31 attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, in which commandos killed and wounded many peace activists in international waters.  The move came after the UN Security Council, denouncing the assault, called for a "prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards."  Meanwhile, the Turkish government has already slammed the inquiry panel set up by the Israeli regime.  "We have no trust at all that Israel… will conduct an impartial investigation," Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.  Israel Announces Own Flotilla Probe Castro Likens Israel to Nazis
