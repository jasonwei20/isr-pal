 Israeli troops stormed the town of Sair in the Hebron district of the southern occupied West Bank early Sunday morning, ransacking the home of deceased Palestinian, Fadi Faroukh, and reportedly threatening to detain the man’s 10-month-old daughter. Fadi’s brother Saed told Ma’an that Israeli soldiers “destroyed the interior of the house” before they “threatened to detain Fadi’s 10-month-old daughter.” Saeed explained that after ransacking the home and threatening the family, the soldiers hung a written warning on the front door, addressing the family as well as all residents of Sair, which read: “In the wake of destructive attacks coming from your area against civilians, the Israeli defense forces and the Israeli security forces will operate with increased effort against terrorists and against anyone involved in such activity. An Israeli army spokesperson said she was looking into reports of the raid and threats made against the family, and against Fadi’s infant daughter in particular. “We will implement a differential policy in Judea and Samaria,” Lieberman said last month, using an Israeli term for the West Bank. “Its purpose is to continue to give benefits to those who desire co-existence with us and make life difficult for those who seek to harm Jews.” Clinton versus Trump: How It Might Matter for the Middle East Meshaal in Amman for His Mother’s Funeral
