 Palestinian Authority security forces have arrested thirteen members of Hamas in different locations of the West Bank, the resistance movement says.  The Hamas members, detained on Wednesday, were students and academics formerly held in Israeli jails.  The arrests came as representatives from the rival faction of Hamas and Fatah, which controls the West Bank, agreed to hold a new round of reconciliation talks in Cairo next month to reach an agreement on the formation of a unity government and to set up a date for elections.  Hamas accuses Palestinian Authority of disrespecting the ongoing inter- Palestinian peace talks by stepping up its arrest campaign against the supporters of resistance.  Tensions between Hamas and Fatah emerged after Hamas’ victory in the 2006 parliamentary elections. Following the elections, Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the democratically elected Hamas government and appointed a Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
