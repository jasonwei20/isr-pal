israel starts freeing hundreds of palestinian prisoners after gingerly stepping off the bus that had brought him here from jail suleiman awajneh one of hundreds of palestinian prisoners freed by israel said today that he knew exactly what he would do once he got home to jericho i ll put a palestinian flag on my house mr awajneh said noting that that he had served more than six months of a one year sentence for raising the flag throwing stones and painting nationalist graffiti flags are no longer a cause for arrest in the territories since last month s accord between israel and the palestine liberation organization on the start of limited self rule by palestinians in jericho and in the gaza strip israel s first big gesture the accord led to today s release of hundreds of prisoners the first substantial gesture by israel toward the p l o since the agreement was signed as many as 700 prisoners are scheduled to be released by tuesday described by the government as a confidence building measure to increase palestinian support for the agreement the release came on the eve of renewed israeli palestinian talks at the egyptian resort of taba on details for carrying out the accord palestinian negotiators have urged that all the prisoners be freed and they are expected to press for more releases when talks resume on tuesday but israeli officials have said freedom for the 9 000 palestinians still jailed will depend on progress in the negotiations the release of the prisoners today was overshadowed by sunday s killing of two israeli soldiers in the gaza strip by gunmen from hamas the militant islamic group that opposes the accord no freedom for militants the slaying prompted prime minister yitzhak rabin to bar the release of members of hamas and a similar group islamic holy war who had been included among the categories of prisoners to be freed they are sick inmates women and prisoners under the age of 18 and over 50 the p l o had demanded the release of islamic militants to show critics that it was acting on behalf of all palestinians not only its loyalists israeli opposition leaders asserted that the mr rabin was encouraging further anti israeli violence by releasing palestinian convicts and they urged a halt to the releases the message to the murderers of the soldiers and to future murderers is it s o k you won t sit in jail and you ll go free said benjamin netanyahu leader of the right wing likud party but mr rabin said that those released today did not have blood on their hands and that there were no immediate plans to free such offenders many of those released today had been convicted of relatively light and varied offenses such as throwing firebombs or taking part in nationalist demonstrations although prisoners received an emotional welcome from relatives and friends the response to their release was subdued in the west bank and the gaza strip where shops were shuttered in observance of a strike that was called to urge a release of all prisoners the army also appeared to have prevented public celebrations because families complained that they had not been notified by the army whether their relatives would be freed and many waited for hours at military checkpoints and bases for prisoners who never arrived what s more the release of a large group of prisoners from the gaza strip was delayed until a curfew forced their waiting families to return home i m happy to be free but i m thinking of those left behind mr awajneh who is 16 said after he arrived in ramallah along with 12 other teen agers from the megiddo jail my happiness is not complete as long as all the prisoners are not released raifa hreish waited outside the ramallah prison for her brother along with with other hopeful families some of whom had decorated their cars with balloons and palestinian flags in expectation of a triumphant ride home if there is a peace agreement it has to be implemented she said all the prisoners have to be let go from all the factions in every country in the world peace means a total prisoner release but there were continued signs that peace was not at hand in the gaza strip a hamas militant drove a car rigged with explosives and gas canisters into a convoy of israeli military government and prisons service vehicles the car failed to explode but two israelis were injured and the assailant was later caught as he tried to escape graphic photo relatives greeting a palestinian prisoner who was among the hundreds freed yesterday by israel agence france presse
