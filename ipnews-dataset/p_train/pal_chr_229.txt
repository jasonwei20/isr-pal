 Former Cuban President Fidel Castro’s commentary comparing Israeli treatment of Palestinians to the Nazi extermination of Jews has infuriated the Tel Aviv regime.  Castro observed in one of his recent articles that the current treatment of Palestinians by the Tel Aviv regime was reminiscent of Israel sending Palestinian masses to the crematoria, where millions of Jews were exterminated by German Nazis.  "It would seem that the Fuehrer’s (Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s) swastika is today Israel’s banner," he added, Reuters reported.  Israel claimed that Castro’s views were cited by Cuba’s diplomatic mission in Geneva amid debate in the United Nations Human Rights Council on Israeli action in the occupied territories.  "With these outrageous comments, Fidel Castro shames his old-time companions and the ideals he always pretended to serve. Che Guevara must be spinning in his grave," claimed Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor.  The ex-Cuban leader, who wrote the article after the recent deadly Israeli attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla aid convoy in international waters, had also condemned the assault.
