 Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in Jenin early Wednesday as soldiers detained an Islamic Jihad leader in the northern West Bank city. Around 12 Israeli army jeeps entered Jenin before dawn and detained Abed al-Halim Ezz al-Din after raiding his home, locals told Ma’an. Palestinians threw rocks and empty bottles at the forces, who fired dozens of tear gas grenades, they added. An Israeli military spokesman said soldiers detained two Palestinians in Jenin, as well as two in Nablus, one in Qalandiya and another in Beit Liqya. He told Ma’an that around 150 Palestinians rioted in Jenin. They threw rocks and molotov cocktails and rolled burning tires toward the forces, the army official said, adding that soldiers responded with riot dispersal means. In Nablus, Israeli forces detained 31-year-old journalist Mohammad Anwar Muna during a raid on his home. Muna works for Al-Quds Press. Soldiers confiscated his computer and cell phone, locals told Ma’an. Ahmad Mohammad Abu Jamous, 30, was also detained in Nablus, locals said. Meanwhile, soldiers handed out several orders summoning Palestinians in Nablus to attend questioning with Israeli intelligence, they added.
