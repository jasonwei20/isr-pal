israel ends curfew in jericho but hope remains confined the curfew imposed here after the hebron massacre was lifted today and jericho the would be capital of an embryo palestine returned to normal that is to say american tourists fresh from baptism in the jordan river frolicked on camels under the gaze of israeli soldiers ihab atayi a palestinian wondered if peace would ever come and inject some energy into his new business in satellite dishes and badr bassan a 26 year old carpentry teacher predicted that even if peace came it would not be worth having we are in a small cage he said cupping his hands peace is supposed to make the cage bigger he said spreading his hands a little but the door and the key are with the israelis a curfew remains in effect in hebron and three other west bank towns after israel and the palestine liberation organization reached an accord in september promising autonomy for the gaza strip and jericho this town bubbled with hope many expected a boom as palestinian leaders in exile surged back home to settle and to buy everything from television antennas to shampoo but the snags that have postponed the israeli troop withdrawal scheduled to begin on dec 13 and other setbacks that culminated in the hebron massacre of muslims at prayer on feb 25 have stifled most of that hope possibly because expectations were so high the decline has been that much more abrupt since a jewish settler gunned down the muslim worshipers nothing not the renewal of contacts between israel and the p l o in cairo on monday nor a public hearing today in jerusalem on what happened at hebron seems to send a flicker through the gloom we are with arafat said omar ahmed khamis who sells trinkets for tourists offering the p l o chairman what initially seemed an expression of support which is increasingly unusual in the occupied territories but every time like yesterday in cairo it is just talk arafat has nothing in his hands he said we want peace but he can t get peace because the israelis don t want it mr atayi the satellite dish entrepreneur said as a result of the massacre no one expects anything to happen personally i have lost my hope nor is business booming very few people seem to be interested mr atayi said gesturing to a model dish near a wall painting of yasir arafat from cadillacs to kerchiefs startling incongruities and sad tales are plentiful here in the jordan valley a 36 year old palestinian who would identify himself only as mohammed was selling a small bundle of red and black kaffiyehs the traditional arab kerchiefs to busloads of tourists this is temporary work he said it was also quite a change before the persian gulf war he said he had lived and prospered for 24 years in kuwait selling mercedes and cadillacs even after the war ended in early 1991 he said business blossomed because kuwaitis wanted to replace cars looted by the iraqis or destroyed in the war then kuwait turned against palestinians who were viewed as pro iraqi and mohammed came to join his wife and four children in jericho talk of peace persuaded him to invest here but his kuwaiti partner refused to return his share of the money from their automobile dealership so mohammed is selling kaffiyehs then there is the 1 200 seat mount temptation restaurant next to the ruins of ancient jericho and below the hill that christians hold to be the site of jesus temptation we never had a cancellation not one said the restaurant owner khaled abdelrazik abu raed through the most recent curfew indeed through the long years of the palestinian uprising that began in 1987 he said the place never closed what s really important you can t live without the tourists he warned if you are going to build a country you need the tourists today that meant people like tasha greathouse 22 a student from the pentecostalist church of god lee college in cleveland tenn who had joined 30 other people from the school just a week after the hebron massacre on a 1 899 tour of holy sites they assured us that they wouldn t take us into dangerous areas she said had she been worried though if it s my time to go it s my time to go she replied and the result will be heaven so it doesn t bother me too much some tourists like kimberly horstmann 24 from atlanta said they felt spiritually uplifted after being re baptized in the jordan river we believe no particular religion should put down another she said expressing a view that has not been practiced too consistently in these parts graphic map of israel shows the location of jerico
