at 702 on the am dial a duel by arafat s friends and foes when palestinians here and in the gaza strip tuned in today to the palestine liberation organization s new radio station they were stunned to hear yasir arafat the p l o chairman described as a clown an insolent manipulator a hijacker and a traitor just two days after the station was born its frequency was taken over by a palestinian group fiercely opposed to the p l o s peace accord with israel so instead of good morning from the voice of palestine listeners heard a virulent broadside from jerusalem broadcasting the arab palestinian broadcast on the way to liberate the land the station is directed by the palestinian front for the liberation of palestine general command which is based in damascus syria this group is led by ahmed jabril who the united states government says is a terrorist using more powerful equipment than that of the p l o jerusalem broadcasting exhorted the palestinian masses for hours to rebel against the p l o and reject the agreement with israel fighting for a frequency israel which controls radio transmissions has complicated the p l o s radio effort by assigning it the am frequency that is used by mr jabril s group which broadcasts from damascus if the palestinian station is off the air or its equipment is not working properly mr jabril s broadcasts arrive on the same frequency the p l o is violating the most elemental principles of democracy and fairness when it moves in to take over jerusalem broadcasting s wave said fadil shourour who was described in the radio s commentary as the director of the station it is the first early signal of the totalitarian tendencies of arafat arafat wants to shut down dissent mr shourour said in a stinging commentary broadcast every half hour as the voice of palestine remained silent much of the day but bassim abu sumaya the director of the p l o station said what can we do the israelis gave us band 702 they could have given us another band but they said it was the only one available we don t want to fight with jerusalem broadcasting or anyone else we just want our radio but it seems that fighting among us is just what the israelis want to see mr sumaya spoke on the staircase of a three story building with a palestinian flag flying above but only a skeletal staff and meager equipment inside unlike the syrian sponsored station the voice of palestine is short of money and its ability to broadcast air is limited the programming so far has been modest on its first day friday it braodcast music including the palestinian national anthem a speech by mr arafat was broadcast on saturday today when the station came on the air after 4 p m more songs were played responding to suggestions that israel assigned the 702 frequency knowing the syrian based group could override the signal uri dromi the head of the government press office said as far as we are concerned everything is kosher here a spokesman for the ministry of communications gustavo trever said the problem is that the syrian based station has a more potent transmitter than that of the voice of palestine he said that under the peace accord with the p l o israel retains control of the airwaves in the past israel tried to block the broadcasts from syria but it concluded that they tended to discredit militant palestinians rather than win new converts mr jabril and his syrian sponsors in turn came to look upon their unrestricted broadcasts to israel as a right syria sponsors nearly a dozen arab groups opposed to peace with israel on saturday the governing party s newspaper called mr arafat s visit to gaza a humiliation for palestinians because it was taking place under israeli protection
