 The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says it has managed to reconstruct most of the buildings destroyed during the December 2008-January 2009 Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip.  Hamas Interior Minister Fathi Hammad said on Tuesday that the resistance movement managed to plan and implement the reconstruction activities "immediately after the Israeli offensive," and "despite lack of proper means," a Press TV correspondent reported.  Israel launched an all-out military offensive on the besieged Gaza Strip three days before the turn of 2009. The ensuing three-week war killed more than 1,400 Palestinians, including many women and children.  Several police stations and security posts also came under attack across the enclave. Some 300 police officers lost their lives in the conflict.  "The interior ministry was the main target during the aggression. Most of the security posts, police stations and governmental buildings in the Gaza Strip were destroyed, but today we have rebuilt most of them. We have got rid of all forms of corruption and lawlessness in Gaza in the last couple of years," said Ehab Ghussain, Hamas interior ministry spokesperson.  Police officers in Gaza now receive educational workshops on how to deal with different situations such as fighting drugs and crime, and the security situation in the enclave is under control.  The Israeli regime laid an economic siege on the Gaza Strip in June 2007 after the democratically-elected Hamas took over the administration of the enclave.  Israel also denies some 1.5 million people in Gaza their basic rights, including the freedom of movement and their rights to appropriate living conditions, work, health and education.
