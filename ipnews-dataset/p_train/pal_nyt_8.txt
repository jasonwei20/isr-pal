mideast accord jericho where p l o is to rule it is nowhere to be seen on the day after the signing of the accord on palestinian rule in jericho and gaza the mood of this sleepy town of 15 000 palestinians was to say the least morose the only thing that has changed in jericho today is that israeli army roadblocks surrounding us have tripled said seif jamil the owner of maxim an outdoor restaurant normally frequented by tourists and travelers to the jordanian border most people are banned from entering town including tourists so jericho has really got its independence today from the world today no tourists stopped here nor have there been the slightest signs of any senior officials from the palestine liberation organization since an incident on wednesday in which several p l o representatives were pelted with stones by palestinian youths as they rode into town in israeli army jeeps to discuss a transfer of authority poor public relations they shouldn t have come with the israelis said abed sidr a local p l o official who complained that the leadership has failed to contact him or any other palestinian in jericho about how to transfer power they should have told us they were coming and we would have taken measures to give them a warmer reception i told the israeli military governor they were hit because of you because they were riding with you mr sidr said frankly so far all i see from this self rule agreement is bad news for jericho he sat on his villa s terrace surrounded by a dozen local palestinian leaders who overwhelmingly shared his negative views everybody in town feels the same way he said nobody is talking to us israelis are tightening the isolation of the town and the p l o is not answering the phone or making any calls that is why there is no joy in jericho in jericho where the p l o chairman yasir arafat is supposed to live when the accord is carried out the empty streets reflect the gloomy view there is an abundance of painted slogans saying yes to elections no to appointments which are aimed at the p l o s leaders abroad fresh roadblocks manned by israeli soldiers have been set up about a mile outside the city which is a 20 minute drive from jerusalem usually such roadblocks are negotiable by drivers in cars with yellow israeli license plates and by tourists and journalists in cars with the green or blue plates that note arab registry but for much of the morning today the standing order at roadblocks was that only jericho residents were allowed in or out by early afternoon the ban on tourists eased but most stores were shuttered restaurants largely empty and streets deserted the sense of isolation deepened further this afternoon as the residents whose livelihood depends partly on travelers to and from jordan listened to radio reports in which jordan warned that it viewed the accord as a private palestinian israeli matter that does not concern jordan the jordanian radio commentary which tends to reflect the views of the government said the accord would further isolate palestinians under israeli occupation what makes a change is if people are allowed to come in and leave town i mean not only israeli army or the p l o policemen but people mr jamil the restaurant owner said do you see any people around he peered over a dozen empty tables where on such a beautiful spring afternoon dozens of customers could have been expected a question of credibility at the kurdiyah family villa reportedly to be mr arafat s residential headquarters a young man at the gate said with a mischievous smile that he could not say whether the villa has been purchased or whether mr arafat would move in at the police station two israeli police cars were parked in the front yard leaving the impression that an israeli pullout has yet to occur uncertainty surrounds every aspect of what was supposed to be the beginning of a process that could lead to an independent palestinian state the uncertainty is fueled by what is widely referred to as the shabby behavior of the p l o leadership including a pattern of ignoring palestinians who have suffered through 27 years of israeli occupation in favor of exiles coming from tunis to take power here khalil abu assal a middle aged palestinian businessman used mr arafat s nom de guerre in summing up a common opinion abu ammar s credibility now lies in the economic performance of his team he has failed the test on popularity security trust etc but if he can make things better for us economically it will be okay for him if he cannot or does not you are looking here and in gaza at the shifting sands that will swallow the p l o
