 Acting Palestinian Authority Chief Mahmoud Abbas says the best response to Israel’s attack on the Gaza-bound aid convoy is Palestinian unity.  "The best answer to (the raid) is for Palestinian groups to reconcile and resist Israel hand-in-hand," Abbas said in an interview with Turkey’s NTV news channel on Monday.  The PA chief added that he would send a delegation to the Gaza Strip and seek reconciliation with the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas.  The move comes after Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal last Tuesday called for reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah faction, led by Abbas, saying all Palestinian groups should be united against Israel. Abbas described the Israeli assault against the Gaza Freedom Flotilla which left many dead and wounded as a "massacre."  He called for more aid convoys to be sent to Gaza to put pressure on the Tel Aviv regime into ending its three-year-long blockade on the coastal sliver.  Abbas said everything must be tried in order to end the Israeli siege and pressures that are being imposed on the Palestinian people.
