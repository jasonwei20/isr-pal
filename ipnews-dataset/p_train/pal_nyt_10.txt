hebron massacre further wounds arafat s image a week after the massacre of palestinian worshipers by an israeli gunman yasir arafat plagued by mounting defections from his dispirited p l o and widespread disillusionment over his efforts to promote peace has become one of most reviled figures in the occupied territories since the accord between israel and the palestine liberation organization was signed last september numerous p l o leaders have quit disgruntled with what they see as unconscionable concessions to israel and high handed manipulations by mr arafat but the massacre in hebron appears to have accelerated the deterioration of support for the p l o especially at the grass roots level in dozens of interviews with palestinians this week in jerusalem the west bank and gaza there was nearly universal condemnation of both the p l o chairman and the peace accord he backs people have turned against not just chairman arafat but anyone associated with the peace process said saeb erakat one of the chief palestinian delegates to the talks with the israelis which have been suspended we promised people that things would get better and instead we have witnessed one of the worst massacres in our history when i marched with palestinians last september they all said we should give the negotiations a chance now they say that chance is finished the antagonism comes at a time of extraordinarily high emotions among palestinians and it is not clear how long they will remain at that pitch pictures and posters of the grinning palestinian leader are often defaced not by the israeli authorities who have given up trying to control graffiti but by palestinians themselves residents regularly spit on the ground or curse when asked about him especially disturbing to arafat loyalists is the defection of many members of the fatah hawks the loosely knit military wing of al fatah mr arafat s faction the hawks are to form the backbone of the palestinian police force after israelis withdraw and their defection could further aggravate the anarchy and violence of the occupied territories mr arafat s troubles have also proved politically advantageous to the islamic militant organization hamas which opposes the peace accord support for hamas is clearly on the rise even within mr arafat s faction israeli troops brokered an agreement with the fatah hawks last november that turned over some areas to the organization both sides have since refrained from attacking the other a straying of the hawks but many fatah hawks are now ready to fight the israelis again since the hebron attack gunmen from the fatah hawks and hamas have paraded together through the rutted streets of gaza hebron and jericho in one such display of solidarity masked fatah hawks many carrying automatic weapons entered the street in gaza with members of the qassim brigades the armed wing of hamas we are all ready to renew attacks against israeli soldiers and settlers said a leader of the hawks as he stood in a garbage strewn alley among his men we have given up on the peace process and we can t stand by while israelis massacre our people arafat and his people in tunis tried to make peace but we are the ones who live here and must protect our people we have no choice it is probably premature to write off mr arafat who has plenty of time to rebound before the palestinian elections set for july but likely to be postponed but if the peace talks remain stymied and violence continues it could strengthen the hand of hamas the people here see nothing good from this agreement said sami abu samhadaneh who recently resigned from the p l o steering committee in the gaza strip they are furious at arafat for making concessions while the israelis continue the occupation and the murder of palestinians they don t see him appointing the right people they don t see improvements disillusionment is total in hebron now closed and under nearly constant curfew palestinian flags have been replaced by black flags of mourning when a car entered the city with the palestinian flag in the window a crowd made the driver remove it that is arafat s flag said one young man derisively little faith in peace jabrin natsheh whose brother was killed in the massacre stood at a reception hall in hebron receiving visitors who were expressing condolences the p l o no longer represents us he said it does not ask us our opinion it carries out talks while we live in a prison i don t believe this peace settlement will ever happen mr arafat suspended the talks after the massacre and called for international protection for the palestinians and the disarming of the 120 000 jewish settlers he has called for the dismantling of provocative settlements set up in the heart of palestinian cities but even the measures demanded by the p l o which prime minister yitzhak rabin appears unwilling to accept may not be enough to bridge the gap between the aging palestinian leaders and the bitter young men who throng the streets in gaza and the west bank there are deep divisions now between the leadership which comes from an older generation that often lives outside the country and the young people who sacrificed and carried out the uprising said ihab al ashkar another former member of the p l o steering committee in gaza the leadership has lost touch and because it has lost touch it is losing control many mistakes have been made many people have been neglected the young men s frustration was fed by recent p l o appointments that went to arafat cronies in the large yellow stucco house in gaza city that is home to the local p l o headquarters officials played down the disenchantment these posters of chairman arafat were defaced by children said sobeh k masri a p l o official most people are still behind him but even mr masri admitted mr arafat could find himself deserted by some of his rank and file it may be impossible to stop our young men from resuming violent attacks against the settlers if the israelis do not disarm them said mr masri especially if the israelis also continue to delay the withdrawal there is only so much we can do in the sprawling market in the shati refugee camp in gaza city vendors stood over wooden carts piled with green chili peppers eggplants and tomatoes in the crush of shoppers it was hard to find anyone who had good words for the p l o chief every young man now has a duty to get himself a gun and shoot israelis said abu al abed 40 a beefy man in an old green overcoat we have had enough of arafat s talk what has it given us more dead more suffering and more occupation graphic photo palestinian women walking past israeli policemen after friday s prayers at al aksa mosque in jerusalem to prevent unrest
