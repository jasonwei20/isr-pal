 A Palestinian woman who was inseminated using sperm smuggled from her jailed husband has given birth, Ma’an news agency reported on Thursday. Her husband, Abdul Kareem al-Rimawi, is currently serving a 25-year jail sentence. He has been in prison for 12 years. Lida, 34, gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Majd on Wednesday, Ma’an reported. The baby was conceived at the Razan clinic by IVF after al-Rimawi’s sperm was smuggled out of the prison. It is the second birth of this kind at the clinic. In 2012 Dalal Rabayaa gave birth to a baby boy at the same center, also after smuggling her husband’s sperm out of prison and using IVF treatment to become pregnant. The details of how the sperm was smuggled have not been revealed because of security concerns. The prisoners are separated from their visitors by glass panels and are denied conjugal visits, a spokeswoman for the prisons told The New York Times. According to medical sources, there are 16 women who claim to have become pregnant by smuggling their husband’s sperm from Israeli prisons, Ma’an reported.
