israel decides not to charge palestinian with p l o ties israel s attorney general has decided not to press criminal charges against the palestinian leader hanan ashrawi for supposedly defying an israeli law that prohibits contact with the palestine liberation organization the state radio reported today although a justice ministry spokeswoman denied that a conclusion had been reached the israeli radio said attorney general yosef harish had already told associates that he was persuaded to close the ashrawi file because of insufficient evidence and because an indictment would harm israel s interests in the middle east peace process the reported decision while unofficial was consistent with recent remarks by some government leaders and members of parliament who find the criminal case an embarrassment as israel prepares for new peace negotiations in early december with the palestinians and other arab delegations a police inquiry had focused on charges that faisal al husseini leader of the palestinian team at the madrid peace conference and mrs ashrawi the group s spokeswoman met with the p l o leadership in late september as holders of east jerusalem identity cards they are covered by israeli laws in this case a statute banning contacts with terrorist groups a category that israel says applies to the p l o both palestinians denied the charges but the israeli police while essentially clearing mr husseini said last week that there was enough evidence to bring mrs ashrawi to trial the finding touched off an international outcry including an expression of concern from president bush and the israeli government has been back pedaling ever since health minister ehud olmert who is close to prime minister yitzhak shamir complained that the timing of the police recommendation was poor and that it made little sense to accuse mrs ashrawi of meeting with the p l o when israel considers her to be a p l o representative in the occupied territories so what can you say mr olmert said that she should stand trial for meeting with herself the dispute has given fresh impetus to a campaign to scrap the law as undemocratic the opposition labor party has called over the last week for its repeal and several dozen members of parliament have urged the release of abie nathan an israeli peace campaigner who was sentenced last month to a year and a half in prison for meeting with the p l o leader yasir arafat graphic photo the palestinian leader hanan ashrawi will not have criminal charges pressed against her by israel s attorney general it was announced she talked to reporters yesterday after meeting with the united states consul molly williamson in ramallah in the occupied west bank associated press
