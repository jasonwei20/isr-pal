pm warns of retaliation for abbass diplomatic warfare sharp diplomatic setback as palestine joins interpol jerusalem will not let continuous palestinian diplomatic steps against israel go without a response prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on wednesday evening in reaction to interpols decision earlier in the day to admit the palestinians as a member state netanyahus comment came at a meeting in his office with us envoy jason greenblatt us ambassador david friedman and israels ambassador to the us ron dermer the prime ministers office did not indicate what that response would be but jerusalem affairs minister zeev elkin did give an indication of what measures might be considered he said following the interpol decision that israel should immediately cancel all cabinet decisions regarding gestures toward the palestinians made over the last two years and that it should revoke the vip passes given to the heads of the palestinian authority enabling easier passage into israel according to the prime ministers office netanyahu said at the meeting that the actions of the palestinian leadership are violations of previous agreements with israel and severely damages the chances of achieving peace netanyahu directed dermer to see whether the palestinian moves at the icc are a violation of us law which could conceivably lead to a closure of the plo offices in washington the interpol vote came just a week after netanyahu told the un general assembly how israels stature on the world stage was steadily improving the move passed in a secret ballot by a vote of 75 to 24 with 34 abstentions the palestinians needed more than two thirds of the yes or no votes counted and passed that threshold handily after the un interpol with 190 member states is the largest international organization in the world the solomon islands also gained membership on wednesday a palestinian bid to join the organization fell short last year secret ballots in international organizations generally work against israel as it prevents jerusalem from being able hold countries that vote against it accountable following the anti settlement un security council resolution in december which was a public vote israel took punitive measures against a number of states such as senegal new zealand angola and ukraine that voted against it the palestinian initiative to join interpol is part of an overall strategy to join as a state as many organizations as possible they withdrew their bid earlier this month to join the uns world tourism organization following intense us pressure the us however has a degree of leverage on international organizations under the un umbrella such as the wto that it doesnt have with international organizations that are independent of the un according to us law washington must cut funding to un organizations that accept palestine as a state that law does not extend however to international groups outside the un system greenblatt who arrived in the country on monday tried to get the palestinians to back away from this bid as well to no avail it was not immediately clear whether the us did not push as hard this time as it did concerning the wto or whether the palestinians simply decided to buck the american pressure israel is adamantly opposed to palestinian admission to all international organizations arguing that a state of palestine does not exist and therefore it cannot be accepted as a state in international organizations the palestinian admission to interpol follows by two years its last success in joining a major international institution when it gained membership into the international criminal court likewise the concern is that the palestinians will use interpol as a platform to continuously needle israel perhaps by asking the organization to issue arrest warrants against israeli citizens though such requests in no way bind the organization and even though interpol does not have enforcement capabilities in any event this could be a significant nuisance causing israel headaches wednesdays developments in beijing began poorly for israel when the plenum rejected a move to postpone consideration of the palestinian application for another year the palestinians mustered the support of 61 of the nations to defeat that measure israel and some of its supporters in the un general assembly then tried to block the vote through a procedural maneuver claiming there were irregularities on an earlier vote regarding the criteria needed to accept new members into the organization that too failed while the foreign ministry did not issue an immediate response opposition politicians quickly reacted former foreign minister tzipi livni zionist union said the move was bad for israel and bad for the war on terrorism she placed the onus of responsibility on the government for not leading a diplomatic process with the palestinians when israel abandons the diplomatic field the palestinians take it and unfortunately have successes from their standpoint that harm israel she said former prime minister ehud barak tweeted that the decision is another failure for netanyahu in reference to the prime ministers speech last week at the un barak said the decision shows that the gap between impressive but hollow speeches and reality is growing larger
