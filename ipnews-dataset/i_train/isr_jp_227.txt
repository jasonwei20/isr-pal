what changed when palestine joined the iccs rome statute with all of the ceremony fiery rhetoric and doomsday scenarios surrounding palestine becoming a party to the international criminal courts governing rome statute it is important to pin down what has changed so far with part of the answer being not much the palestinians really acceded to the rome statute in january and wednesday just saw that accession formally taking effect because accessions and ratifications of treaties have a waiting period palestine can now take part in the assembly of state parties which is the legislative body connected to the icc also others can now file war crimes complaints against fatah and hamas either regarding actions against israel or against each other bensouda not the palestinian authority will still ultimately decide whether to open full criminal investigations or file indictments with all of her actions on the issue right now and likely for months if not years consisting of preliminary checking of whether there are jurisdictional issues that block any case from going forward the list of issues that could stop the whole icc process in its tracks is long and formidable so most of the concern now from the israeli side is what could happen down the road in the worst case scenario ultimately april 1 was another small notch in the palestine belt on a long voyage that may never reach shore
