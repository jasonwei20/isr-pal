should jordan be palestine if youve heard former mk aryeh eldad speak in the past few years before recent knesset elections at least you probably heard him say something like this the vast majority of jordan is palestinian in fear of an uprising the king of jordan has his private airplane running 24 hours a day seven days a week to whisk him away in case of a revolt he should declare that jordan is the palestinian national homeland or seek asylum in london such language there was also a petition and a pamphlet is only the most recent incarnation of a push for jordan is palestine a slogan many on the right still adhere to in a lengthy 1988 article on the topic for commentary rejecting jordan is palestine middle east scholar daniel pipes and international affairs expert adam garfinkle documented many proponents of the theory even practical israeli plans for potentially realizing it and pipes continues to update the article on his website with quotations of relevant personalities who maintain the opinion as eldad has explained the goal of making jordan into palestine is to lessen pressure on israel to implement the two state solution once jordan becomes palestine the the palestinians would lose their orphan status as a people without a state and their international demands will become much weaker the two state solution would become meaningless as there would already be a palestinian state and there would therefore be much less of an argument for israel to withdraw from judea and samaria something jordan is palestine proponents rightly fear would lead to grave danger for israel if only it were that simple western pressure on israel is not founded only upon the slogan two states for two peoples such pressure is based on geopolitical factors such as the millions of arabs and muslims who comprise multiple states who control large swaths of territory and important resources who are sizable minorities of european states and who oppose israels existence without regard to western formulations it is based in an unspoken anti semitism the feeling that these israelis these jews are manipulative land grabbers who take whats not theirs who act like they can do whatever they want when in reality if it werent for outside support they would never survive the arab onslaught its based in western guilt over imperialism and colonialism and a jewish tendency to blame ourselves for the wrongdoing of others it finds rationalization and open expression in liberal terminology such as independence human rights national aspirations democracy occupation apartheid and two states for two peoples but thats only the gift wrapping so on the day jordan is renamed palestine israels detractors will not wake up enlightened to the falseness of the claims of apartheid and occupation western ambassadors will not turn to their arab counterparts and say your claim is resolved we wont play along with your war against israel any longer on the day jordan becomes palestine the pressure on israel will increase in place of a state ruled by a hashemite monarchy allied with the us which controversially entered into a treaty with israel and which cooperates with israel on security matters there would instead be a state ruled by a majority that believes israels existence is a nakba a catastrophe committed by the most vile people that israel is actually their homeland wrongfully stolen from them and they would have all the tools of statehood diplomatic and military as well as a very long shared border at their disposal to right that wrong and create more instability a palestinian ruled jordan therefore represents a danger almost identical to perhaps even greater than a palestinian state in judea and samaria and no hasbarah public diplomacy activist or ambassador complaining about how the two state solution was already implemented is going to change that the jordan is palestine plan is thus a right wing fantasy which mirrors the left wing fantasy of the two state solution both are based on the assumption that if the palestinians had a state of their own the conflict would cease israel would capture the moral high ground and the fundamental perception of the conflict would shift that it would become be a run of the mill territorial dispute between states etc the right wing version however is more hypocritical as its proponents recognize something their left wing counterparts fail to that the creation of a palestinian state in the west bank would not lead to an end of the conflict or improve israels diplomatic position despite this recognition the jordan is palestine proponents pursue in the east bank the very logic they rightfully reject with regard to the west bank there is however an important hasbarah function served by the jordan is palestine argument its a reminder of a history that has been forgotten ignored and repressed the history of how the international community unanimously recognized the historical connection of the jewish people to palestine and the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country and how judea and samaria is not alien territory to jews but part of their homeland which was illegally conquered and ethnically cleansed of its jews by jordan in 1948 and renamed the west bank in 1950 that history undermines the narrative that israels creation was a post holocaust scheme in which the jews with guilt ridden european help stole land which was not their own and all the policy implications that narrative carries such as the alleged need to establish a palestinian state in judea and samaria its also a reminder of how that policy has already failed as once before territory the jews sought every expert knows that for a prosperous palestine an adequate territory beyond the jordan is indispensable herbert samuel once said prior to becoming high commissioner and which was part of actually the majority of the land promised to them was relinquished and handed over to arabs yet arab aspirations were not satiated and violent opposition to zionism did not abate it also asks the reader if a palestinian arab state already exists why does justice demand that there be another one but hasbarah has its limits and whatever the utility of jordan is palestine as a hasbarah point it does not remove the danger that jordan is palestine as a peace plan would pose dangers which all of the history prior and subsequent to israels establishment point to the writer is a political activist and an attorney
