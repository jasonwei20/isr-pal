hebron is a shared heritage site in palestine unescos world heritage committee decision on friday to inscribe the old city of hebron including the tomb of the patriarchs ibrahimi mosque as a world heritage site sent off the usual chorus of the whole world is against us i would argue that more than anything the automatic outrage demonstrates how central cultural and religious heritage sites have become in justifying israels sense of righteousness about holding onto the west bank prime minister benjamin netanyahus reaction to the decision that this time they ruled that the tomb of the patriarchs in hebron is a palestinian site meaning its not a jewish one shows just how far weve come in approaching heritage sites as a zero sum game the decision itself by the way specifically says that the al mosque ibrahim tomb of the patriarchs became a site of pilgrimage for the three monotheistic religions judaism christianity and islam while the name al mosque ibrahim is mentioned before the tomb of the patriarchs judaism is mentioned first in the list of religions for which the site is significant the truth is that hebron and particularly the tomb of the patriarchs ibrahimi mosque is a quintessential example of a shared heritage site sacred to jews muslims and also christians and of clear universal historical value what a pity that it is falling victim to the awful feuds over who was here first what netanyahu and others are really worried about is not that the jewish identity of the site will be lost but that a large part of the international community recognizes that hebron is in palestine this is unacceptable and any scare tactics including the conflation of religious and cultural attachment to a site with the right to political sovereignty is acceptable in this smorgasbord of faulty reasoning and spin unesco also bears responsibility for the breakdown of trust between israel and the organization there have been plenty of decisions on the old city of jerusalem declared a world heritage site in 1981 and a world heritage site in danger in 1982 that have underplayed the significance of jerusalem for the jewish people but lately israel has proven that even decisions with much more inclusive wording will not be tolerated unesco is a political body with member states just like other un bodies it also comprises professional bodies there are 10 criteria based on which a site can be admitted as a world heritage site in order to qualify the site needs to meet at least one of these criteria from a heritage standpoint the tomb of the patriarch merits being inscribed as a world heritage site because its sanctity is archaeologically evident from the herodian period because it preserves remains from the fatimid crusader ayyubid mamluk and ottoman periods and because the tomb became a principal site of pilgrimage for the three monotheistic faiths the palestinians also included the old city of hebron in the nomination for its unique mamluk characteristics the professional body which advises unesco icomos found problems with the palestinians nomination dossier it questioned why it did not include tel rumeida which would have reinforced the nominations multicultural character it also criticized the focus on the mamluk history of the town itself at the expense of the canaanite roman and crusader eras and regretted that the dossier underplayed the association with early jewish and christian societies as well as other islamic periods and while justified these kinds of criticisms are often leveled at nominations when there is a focus on specific historical layers it is definitely a pity that the palestinians did not include tel rumeida the ancient town which dates back to 4000 bce in their nomination although very few would dispute the fact that hebron merits world heritage site status its probably safe to say that those who voted in favor on friday were driven primarily by a desire to support the palestinian right to establish a state along the pre 1967 borders as such it was a protest vote not against the age old jewish connection to hebron but against 50 years of israeli occupation ancient hebron can be jewish yes as well as muslim and also of significance for christians and others but it is not israeli territory the author works for emek shaveh an ngo that promotes a shared heritage approach to archaeological sites and ancient monuments
