war ii broke out learning that her parents had been killed a tragedy she rarely discussed in later years she studied at the hebrew university of jerusalem then met wim van leer a dutch industrialist who like her was a great movie lover they married in the early 1950s other problems with the ultra orthodox followed when she opened the jerusalem cinematheque in the gei ben hinnom valley area known for human sacrifice in ancient times the van leers settled in haifa but also traveled the world as wim ran his business although as lia told it with exaggerated modesty i just schlepped along wherever they went they saw movies and whenever they could they acquired prints of those movies to bring back to israel that personal collection was the basis for the good cinema club which eventually became the haifa cinematheque the movie mad duo used to travel the country in crop dusting planes wim was a pilot to present quality cinema all over the country not only does the festival bring the best of world contemporary cinema to the country but she designed it to encourage and inspire israeli directors to do their best work the main prizes of the festival were given to local films which helped the filmmakers when they released the movies abroad never shy about her leftist leanings van leer made certain to show politically controversial movies at the jerusalem cinematheque the jerusalem film festival gives the in the spirit of freedom award in memory of wim for the best film about human rights the list of guests at the jerusalem film festival and at the jerusalem cinematheque over the

wonderful movies this year although she stepped down from her full time duties at the cinematheque and the festival a few years ago she continued to be president of the cinematheque and was as involved as much as her health permitted last year for the first time the opening night screening was postponed then moved indoors because of operation protective edge and van leer struggled valiantly
