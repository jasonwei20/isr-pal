palestinians present list of 14 delegates for talks asserting their intention to be treated as equals to everyone else at the conference table palestinian negotiators today gave the chief united states representative here a complete list of their delegates to the middle east peace talks planned for oct 30 in madrid the names of the palestinian delegates are a critical issue because israel has placed strict conditions on the palestinians who will go to madrid as part of a joint delegation with jordan among other things the israelis rule out sitting down with anyone who is from east jerusalem or has overt ties to the palestine liberation organization the 14 name list was not made public and a palestinian leader said that if israel got to see the list it would be torn up and a new one drafted nevertheless even without knowing specifically who were proposed israeli officials said they were confident that they could make sure their criteria would be met we ll have our ways said ehud gol a senior adviser to prime minister yitzhak shamir although he is decidedly unenthusiastic about the madrid gathering out of concern that israel will be forced to make territorial concessions to its arab neighbors and not receive solid peace guarantees in return mr shamir says he will recommend when the cabinet meets on sunday that it agree to send an israeli delegation i don t see a better alternative he said on friday after the united states and the soviet union as conference sponsors sent out invitations but while it seems likely mr shamir will prevail his aides foresee a political storm from far right elements of his governing coalition ariel sharon the hawkish housing minister and a rival of mr shamir within their likud party called again today for the prime minister s resignation charging that he had led israel on a mistaken path and continues to anesthetize the public against the truly terrible dangers israel faces three small right wing parties in the governing coalition which could bring down the government if they all walked out have also expressed great unhappiness and have raised questions about whether they would stay on as government partners signs were that they would at least for now even if they do leave the opposition labor party and several small groupings on the left promise to take up the slack and support the government so long as the peace process continues secrecy and jockeying the secrecy surrounding the list of the palestinian delegates reflects a jockeying for tactical position that may get rougher in the days leading to the madrid talks for the palestinians weakened by a string of miscalculations that include its support of iraq in the persian gulf war the peace process has thus far involved large gulps of swallowed pride they have had little choice but to accept israeli terms for their participation but now that the conference looks to be a reality they are seeking to reassert themselves and regain a measure of independence we are not less than anyone said faisal al husseini one of the main palestinian negotiators who has been meeting with secretary of state james a baker 3d this is the way we will be treated no less than anyone no less than any other state one way for him to declare equality was by not disclosing the names on the delegate list which he handed today to the united states consul general in jerusalem molly williamson in this manner the americans can check the names to see if they follow israeli guidelines but the palestinians can also say that the israelis will not have a direct opportunity to reject them before giving their final assent to the conference there is an agreement that these names are not to be vetted or vetoed said hanan ashrawi another palestinian negotiator mr husseini and mrs ashrawi while presumably not delegates themselves because of their east jerusalem identity cards are expected to be part of a six member advisory team to the palestinian delegation their presence in madrid would be likely to increase already strong israeli concerns about how prominent the p l o will be for all the secrecy some names of proposed delegates have filtered out among the reports is that the palestinians will be led by dr haidar abed al shafi a physician from the gaza strip who heads the red crescent society there and is said to be close to left wing palestinian groups other names mentioned are zakaria al agha another gaza physician who also has met frequently with mr baker zia abu ziad a writer and journalist abdel rahman hamad a professor of engineering at bir zeit university in the west bank sami kilani a writer and lecturer at an najah university in nablus hassan al khatib an economics professor from ramallah and radwan abu ayash a ramallah resident who heads the arab journalists association but none of these names have been confirmed
