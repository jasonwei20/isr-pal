surprised meet israels new political center who are israels arab citizens their civic identity is israeli while their national identity is palestinian there are some who want to sharpen the apparent contradiction embedded in this complex identity on the one hand there are jews who demand loyalty to the state as a condition of granting equal rights to arab citizens on the other hand there are arabs who demand the abolition of the states jewish character as a condition for cooperating with israel both groups are eager to whip up jewish arab relations in israel into a maelstrom fueled by mutual suspicion and demonization it is not only members of each sides radical fringe such as mks oren hazan and haneen zoabi who play this game many other jewish and arab politicians are similarly engaged trafficking in hatred and rejectionism however a joint palestinian israeli survey conducted by prof tamar hermann of the israel democracy institute and dr khalil shikaki of the palestinian center for policy and survey research published last month reveals something fascinating the position of arab israelis on the israeli palestinian conflict falls squarely in the political center indeed arab israeli towns and villages sakhnin nazareth kafr yasif and rahat are home to a large group of citizens whose opinions are strikingly different from those of both israeli jews and palestinians living in the west bank and gaza these opinions deserve our serious attention as they cast a ray of light into a seemingly dark place among the surveys respondents israels arab citizens are by far the most optimistic about a shared future whereas only half of palestinians and israeli jews support the two state solution a large majority 87 percent of arab israelis do when pollsters presented respondents with a comprehensive package deal to end the israeli palestinian conflict including the contours of final status arrangements laid on the table in previous rounds of negotiations only 39 of palestinians and israeli jews reacted favorably however arab israelis expressed overwhelming support 90 for these plans a minority of palestinians 40 a majority of jews 64 and almost all arab citizens of israel 91 voiced support for mutual recognition of palestine and israel as the national homelands of their respective peoples a more detailed analysis brings the uniqueness of arab israeli attitudes into sharper focus when it comes to compromise on the status of jerusalem only about 30 of palestinians and jewish israelis agree to the two parts of the city serving as the respective capitals of a palestinian and a jewish state whereas fully three quarters of israeli arabs were prepared to accept such a solution concerning the thorny refugee issue from israels 1948 war of independence the survey asked respondents about one proposal according to which israel would allow the return of 100 000 palestinian refugees as part of a family reunification framework while paying reparations to the rest who would only be allowed to return to the palestinian state jewish israelis vehemently rejected this idea only 17 supported it while palestinians gave it moderate support 49 arab israelis on other hand were overwhelmingly in favor 84 what are the palestinians long term aspirations regarding israel the percentage of jews who believe that the palestinians would like to conquer israel and annihilate its jews is five times that of arab israelis 40 vs 8 however this belief does not moderate the fear of palestinian terrorism which is strong among all israelis jews as a whole 72 west bank settlers in particular 64 and arab citizens 62 the irony is clear while the two armed parties to the conflict are afraid of each other the jewish states arab minority lives in relative comfort and security what to make of all this although one need not agree with the positions held by israels arab citizens it cant be denied that they constitute an independent moderate voice and a promising political middle ground on the palestine israeli conflict in sum there is no resemblance between the actual opinions and attitudes of arab israelis and the caricatures depicted by extremist jewish and arab rabble rousers that is a hopeful conclusion on which visionary leaders could build the writer is vice president for research at the israel democracy institute and professor of law at bar ilan university among the surveys respondents israels arab citizens are by far the most optimistic about a shared future
