as the centenary of world war i grinds its way across the calendar relentless anniversaries of bloodbaths are being memorialized ypres gallipoli and verdun to mention a few but one anniversary is not being recalled as it is not part of the general narrative how german generals and diplomats together with a future pope saved the jews of palestine from genocide the countrys twin jewish communities of zionist pioneers and the old yishuv of orthodox pietists living on charity numbered 85 000 in 1914 on the eve of the global conflagration when the treaty of mudros was signed on october 30 1918 ending hostilities between the ottoman empire and the allies and preceding the november 11 armistice on the western front by two weeks less than half of palestines jews remained these jews were on the verge of starvation and ruin the other 40 000 destitute members of the yishuv had died of starvation epidemics or execution or had been deported as enemy aliens holding russian british french greek or american citizenship gen erich georg anton sebastian von falkenhayn 1861 1922 and gen friedrich kress von kressenstein 1870 1948 were key figures in the little known rescue of the jews of palestine so too was archbishop eugenio pacelli 1876 1958 who became pope pius xii in 1939 and whose subsequent role in the holocaust remains controversial von falkenhayn was the architect of the battle of verdun his notorious memo to kaiser wilhelm ii proposing to bleed the french army white led to the february 1916 attack known as unternehmen gericht operation judgment but by that august it became evident that germany was losing its war of attrition almost as much blood of les boches a contemptuous term for germans was being spilled into the meuse and somme rivers as was that of die froschfresser a contemptuous term for french the frog guzzlers the bloody toll of shrapnel led to germanys replacement in 1916 of the traditional boiled leather pickelhaube headgear with the iconic stahlhelm steel helmet that same year von falkenhayn was replaced as chief of general staff by fellow prussian paul von hindenburg von falkenhayn was reassigned to the palestine front there the germans were serving as advisers commanders and biplane pilots in the war against the british and their colonial troops based in egypt the central powers turkish and austro hungarian forces together with their german officers had failed in raids in january 1915 and again in august 1916 to seize the suez canal now the british were inching across the northern sinai coast as they constructed a supply railroad von falkenhayn remained in charge of german forces in world war i palestine from early 1917 until february 1918 a master of trench warfare von falkenhayn dug in at gaza and repulsed the egyptian expeditionary force at the first battle of gaza in march 1917 the second battle for the ruined city whose 40 000 inhabitants had been deported by the turks occurred a month later the commonwealth war cemeteries in gaza and deir el balah remain as testament to those battles the gaza stalemate was broken in november 1917 when the australian light horse outflanked gaza and overran beershebas surprised defenders in the worlds last successful cavalry charge the front collapsed and on december 9 1917 gen edmund allenby 1861 1936 who replaced the hapless gen sir archibald murray liberated jerusalem allenbys rapid advance toward damascus was halted in march 1918 when many of his soldiers were rushed to flanders to stop germanys great spring offensive utilizing troops freed from the eastern front following the newly founded soviet unions peace treaty by september 1918 the troops were returned to palestine and allenbys offensive resumed leading to his smashing victory at megiddo that month the ottoman commander in syria and palestine navy minister ahmed djemal pasha 1872 1922 grew increasingly suspicious of non muslim and non turkish minorities as the turkish empire disintegrated one of the triumvirate of young turks controlling wartime turkey along with the grand vizier mehmed talaat pasha 1874 1921 and war minister ismail enver pasha 1881 1922 djemal pasha planned severe measures against palestines remaining jews during 1915 the three pashas perpetrated genocide on the christian armenian greek and syriac civilian populations living in eastern anatolia whom the ottomans regarded as disloyal to the sublime porte in constantinople at least 1 5 million armenians alone were murdered in his book the banality of denial israel and the armenian genocide historian yair auron described how the mass murder was perpetrated an important component of the annihilation process in the spring and summer of 1915 was the evacuation and deportation of the armenian population usually the population was given a period of a few days to prepare to be evacuated ostensibly dictated by needs of the war evacuees were permitted to take a limited amount of baggage and they were assured that their homes and assets would be preserved the deportees were concentrated in convoys that began to move toward the syrian desert once they left the villages and cities the men were separated from the women and were murdered nearby the women children and aged were then subjected to a slow and prolonged death as they were forced to walk on foot for hundreds of kilometers along the way the convoys were attacked in sporadic ambushes the hunger thirst cold heat and epidemics raised the number of victims very few of those who began the journey succeeded in making it alive to the end the jews of palestine feared their mass expulsion and massacre were imminent in december 1916 djemal pasha declared that all means must be used to suppress zionism the zionists were diligent and practical people but due to their ideology palestine was liable to become a second armenia he said the majority of palestines jews remained loyal ottoman citizens but dread for their fate motivated some to treasonously join the zion mule corps and fight the turks at gallipoli a handful of zionist jews formed the nili spy network which provided britain with invaluable information on ottoman troop deployments the name is an acronym for the biblical verse netzah yisrael lo yeshaker meaning the eternal one of israel will not lie i samuel 15 29 sarah aaronsohn of zichron yaacov was traveling by train and wagon across turkey to palestine in november 1915 and on her journey she witnessed the armenian genocide in 1916 she joined her brother aharon aaronsohn a well known agronomist in establishing the nili underground caught by the turks in october 1917 at her home and tortured sarah blew her brains out with a gun secreted in her bathroom before incriminating her fellow spies including eitan belkind who served in the turkish army on djemal pashas staff and witnessed the murder of 5 000 armenians in december 1917 the turks hanged his brother naaman and nili leader yosef lishansky in damascus for espionage sarahs brother aharon wrote in his memoirs the turkish order to confiscate our weapons was a bad sign similar measures were taken before the massacre of the armenians and we feared that our people would meet the same kind of fate djemal pashas mass expulsion of some 9 000 foreign jews from jaffa and the eight year old adjoining town of tel aviv on the eve of passover in april 1917 on the pretext that his forces had to make preparations to thwart an amphibious landing by gen allenbys forces similarly augured ill the refugees sought shelter in zionist settlements in the sharon plain the galilee and jerusalem but with foreign aid blocked by the turks and the land ravaged by a plague of locusts in 1915 many of the expelled jews died of hunger and disease 224 of the deportees are buried in kfar saba 321 in tiberias 104 in safed and 75 in damascus in total some 1 500 are believed to have died many were buried in unmarked graves only after allenby completed his conquest of palestine at the end of 1918 were the deportees allowed to return to jaffa and tel aviv german journalist michael hesemann described the situation jamal pasha the turkish commander who was responsible for the armenian genocide threatened the jewish zionist settlers in jaffa more than 8 000 jews were forced to leave their homes which were sacked by the turks two jews were hanged in front of the town gate dozens were found dead on the beach in march the reuters news agency reported a massive expulsion of jews who could face a similar fate as the armenians a report of the zionist office in copenhagen expressed the worry that the jews of palestine would face extermination by hunger thirst and diseases about 10 days after the evacuation of jaffa djemal pasha announced he was ordering the deportation of jerusalems entire civilian population within 24 hours they were to be force marched to transjordan and syria von kressenstein alerted the german embassy in constantinople today istanbul on april 16 1917 german diplomats halted the plan temporarily the evacuation of jerusalem could have been a tragic tactical mistake von kressenstein wrote in his memoirs the uprooting of such a large population would have been liable to cause inestimable results the catastrophic events that occurred to the armenians who were expelled were liable to be repeated here thousands would have died through starvation and disease in the fall of 1917 as allenbys army closed in on jerusalem djemal pasha citing military requirements revived his deportation order and picked november 5 as the zero hour for the evacuation of the citys remaining destitute jews historian isaiah friedmans research in the archives of the austro hungarian empire in vienna and the german empire in berlin revealed von kressensteins intervention against the second deportation further details about djemal pashas murderous intentions are found in richard lichtheims the history of german zionism lichtheim was based in constantinople then the hub of zionist political activity from 1913 to 1917 as the world zionist organizations representative he was a prominent figure in the ottoman capital in forging contacts between the yishuv and the turkish leadership in february 1915 he wrote it seemed as if jamal pasha and his friends were plotting to destroy and annihilate the zionist settlement enterprise in the land of israel in 1921 a representative from palestine reported to the 12th zionist congress taking place in karlsbad czechoslovakia on palestine during the war the report credited foreign consular officials who during the whole period of their stay in the country showed themselves always ready to help and performed valuable services for the jewish yishuv especially deserving of mention are the german vice consul schabiner in haifa the jewish population also benefited by the presence of the head of the german military mission col kress von kressenstein who on several occasions exerted his influence on behalf of the jews von falkenhayn had a stormy relationship with djemal pasha having witnessed the destruction of gaza caused by artillery barrages he refused to send reinforcements to jerusalem in december 1917 lest the holy city and its shrines become a wasteland instead he positioned his forces on the ridges outside the city holger afflerbach of britains leeds university author of falkenhayn political thought and action under the second empire noted von falkenhayns critical role in avoiding a massacre falkenhayn had to supervise turkish measures against jewish settlers who were accused of high treason and collaboration with the english he prevented harsh turkish measures jamal pasha was speaking about evacuation of all jewish settlers in palestine afflerbach continued the parallels to the beginning of the armenian genocide are obvious and striking it started with turkish accusations of armenian collaboration with the russians and the ottomans decided to transport all armenians away from the border to another part of the empire this ended in death and annihilation of the armenians given the fact that palestine was front line in late 1917 something very similar could have happened there to the jewish settlers falkenhayns role was crucial afflerbach explained his judgment in november 1917 was as follows he said that there were single cases of cooperation between the english and a few jewish radicals but that it would be unfair to punish entire jewish communities who had nothing to do with that therefore nothing happened to the jewish settlements only jaffa had been evacuated by jamal pasha von falkenhayn had no particular love for jews according to afflerbach he was in many aspects a typical wilhelmine officer and not even free from some prejudices against jews but what counts is that he saved thousands of jewish lives hesemann author of the pope who defied hitler the truth about pius xii discovered that the german generals and diplomats did not act alone five documents he uncovered in the vatican secret archives documents and now available at the pave the way foundations website show that in 1917 archbishop eugenio pacelli the future pope pius xii but then the apostolic nuncio in munich interceded to protect palestines jews the papers found in the collection of the nuntiatura apostolica baviera under the headline european war palestine no 1 jewish population and the holy city of palestine document pacellis demarche originally the jewish community of neutral switzerland had approached pope benedict xv to use his influence to prevent an ottoman genocide against the jewish population of palestine recognizing how little regard the caliphate would pay to a diplomatic appeal from the vatican benedict xv turned to turkeys most powerful ally the second reich since the holy sees nuntiature was located in catholic munich rather than lutheran berlin the job fell to pacelli who had arrived in bavaria in april 1917 there for all practical purposes was the nuncio to the german empire benedict xv could rely on his nuncio being receptive toward jewish affairs only a few weeks before his transfer to munich when pacelli was still the holy sees undersecretary of state responsible for foreign affairs zionist leader nahum sokolow came to rome to learn about the vaticans position on a future jewish state in palestine sokolow was deeply moved by pacellis sympathy towards zionism to his uttermost surprise pacelli suddenly asked him if he would like to meet the pope sokolow never thought this would be possible for a jew thanks to pacelli a few days later he had a 45 minute private audience with benedict xv the pope called the zionist initiative providential and in accordance with gods will his parting words to the zionist emissary were i am sure we will be good neighbors sokolows six page report on these encounters written on may 10 1917 can be found in the yad vashem archives pacelli was aware that the german government had already declined to intervene on behalf of palestines jews on may 7 1917 social democrat representative oskar cohn spoke in the reichstag about the anti jewish violence in palestine but the german parliament refused to interfere with its turkish ally the deportation of the jews was simply termed a security measure this makes the vatican initiative even more important hesemann stated another element of pressure had to force the german government to act this came from the catholic church with its 25 million believers an important power in the reich immediately after the papal secretary of state requested that pacelli act for the protection of the jewish sites and population of jerusalem the nuncio sent a letter to bavarian secretary of state otto ritter von dandl asking for urgent intervention in berlin hesemann uncovered pacellis draft and final letter as well as the surprising reply because of the alarm sounded by von kressenstein von falkenhayn and others earlier in 1917 germanys foreign ministry sent a diplomatic note to the ottoman government on november 27 1917 according to an internal memorandum they received the reply from constantinople that there is no reason to fear that the turkish authorities in palestine order measures against the jewish population consequently ritter von dandl and through him pacelli were informed two days later according to the available information from the turkish side care was already taken for the protection of the holy sites of jerusalem which are also a subject of veneration by the muslims and also for the population of course this includes the jews who dont have to fear any exemptions zionist officials like jacob thon were well aware of pacellis initiative on january 1 1918 shortly after jerusalems liberation he wrote to the german embassy in constantinople it was a special stroke of good fortune that in the last critical days gen von falkenhayn had the command djemal pasha in this case as he announced often enough would have expelled the whole population and turned the country into ruins we and the whole population christians as well as muslims must remember p acelli with deep gratitude since he saved the civil population from doom when he prevented the planned evacuation of this area pacelli continued to be a friend of jews and zionists even when the holy see adopted a less supportive policy in 1922 the vaticans official newspaper losservatore romano expressed worries about the socialist ideas circulating among zionist settlers but four years later pacelli encouraged german catholics to join and support the newly established german committee pro palestine to support the jewish settlement in palestine among its board members were not only albert einstein but also pacellis closest friend and adviser the german politician and catholic prelate dr ludwig kaas to that list one must add von kressenstein and pacelli their moral courage adds nuance to the unspeakable slaughter of the holocaust that followed a generation later tel aviv berlin sign collaboration to promote start ups in celebration of the 50 years of
