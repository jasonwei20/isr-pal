israel claimed victory on tuesday for helping to delay by at least eight months a palestinian bid to join the international police organization interpol none of the requests were considered individually the assembly determined that before any membership applications were processed more procedural work was necessary this morning we stopped the palestinian attempt to become a member of interpol it was a difficult effort but it bore fruit prime minister benjamin netanyahu said of the vote it reflects what i have said is occurring which is that israels standing in the international community is changing as it builds ties with additional nations netanyahu also said it is important to take into account that this battle the battle in international organizations reflects not just our interests but the interests of many nations adding that the battle will most certainly continue interpol explained in a statement posted on its website that the suspension of the requests follows the decision made by the executive committee in june that a clear and transparent process with a defined set of criteria for membership of interpol was required to that end interpol stated that hans corell former under secretary general for legal affairs and legal counsel of the united nations will study the issue and present his conclusions to the 86th general assembly in beijing while the study is being carried out all current and future applications for membership including those from the republic of kosovo the state of palestine and the solomon islands have been suspended it stated sixty two delegates at the meeting voted to suspend membership requests 56 voted against and 37 abstained our request was not achieved in this session because the interpol executive committee said it would study new membership requests next year ammar hejazi a palestinian delegate at the congress told palestine radio israel worked against the pa in interpol as part of its fierce diplomatic battle with the palestinians who seek de facto recognition of statehood through the application as it pushes to be recognized as a state in as many international bodies as possible in addition the palestinians are pushing forward resolutions against israel in many international bodies particularly the united nations the pa has relied in this pursuit on the automatic majority support it already enjoys in the international arena particularly given that some 136 un member states already have recognized palestinian statehood this does not however include most of the western powers at the interpol general assembly israels attempt to block the pa was helped by some lucky timing and geopolitics because kosovo also sought interpol membership in that same session like the pa kosovo is also seeking unilateral de facto statehood recognition by joining as many international bodies as possible russia in particular is opposed to kosovo unilateral independence the vote occurred just before russian prime minister dmitry medvedev begins a visit to israel on thursday a joint statement by the foreign ministry and israel police said the vote represents a major achievement and reflects the shift in israels international status and the successes of israeli diplomacy the statement added that israel viewed the palestinian attempt to join interpol as part of the ongoing palestinian campaign to evade a direct negotiation process and to allocate the conflict to professional international bodies in a way that disrupts their duties hejazi said israel cannot stop the palestinians from joining any international bodies they israel are trying to score fake and unreal victories they are selling their people illusions he said
