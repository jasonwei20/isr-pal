an israeli living in ramallah its illegal the idf prohibits israeli jews from entering palestinian cities in the west bank yet that doesnt stop one man from crossing checkpoints to live in ramallah mounting a bike in east jerusalem hillel efflal pedals hard as he rides up and down winding roads in the judean hills palestinian boys gawk shout and laugh at him few others cycle in the west bank moreover he is treadling a custom made tall bike his head riding three meters in the air efflal was born and bred on kibbutz yiftah all day long he chain smokes fat spliffs part tobacco and part hashish he seems eccentric like a post army boy who treks to the far east and meditates in an ashram he isnt your normal israeli tall and blond he speaks english like a new yorker despite growing up in the holy land he chose to not serve in the army and he paints palestinian political murals for commission efflals part time home town ramallah sitting amid a sea of israeli settlements and military checkpoints is also the bustling provisional capital of the palestinian authority so why would an israeli jew to live in ramallah curiosity he said in an interview with the magazine i knew i could speak to people and to meet people i didnt just come here to eat falafel family and friends tried to talk him out of the journey i dont think its wise to go efflals father warned him upon returning to the kibbutz for shabbat dinner its very dangerous the situation is very tense now efflal chuckled dismissing their safety concerns arriving under the guise of a canadian tourist he does indeed carry a foreign passport courtesy of his german grandfather who fled just prior to the holocaust but he has yet to use it in ramallah it contains no visa since hes an israeli citizen he wasnt happy to keep mum about his israeli heritage i dont like to lie about this he said especially with people he actually knows he thought of crashing for a night at the run down yet charming hostel in ramallah his stay there would soon turn into four months as efflal found no need to hide his identity palestinian friends surprised him by how much they actually didnt care and they seemed supportive if anything they wanted to hear what israel was like ive met friends here whove never gone to jerusalem and theyve lived here their entire lives in ramallah i mean its crazy jerusalem could be 10 minutes away by car he said recognizing the risk if he were exposed as an israeli in the wrong crowd efflal seemed to think out loud its something i never got a chance to test with people i dont trust he said smirking not entirely off limits very few other israeli jews live in ramallah one is haaretz correspondent amira hass she avoids driving through the kalandiya checkpost hass told me last year in an effort to avoid a legal imbroglio instead she breezes through israeli only roads claiming settler residency another israeli residing here tali shapira is a full time activist with the group anarchists against the wall she travels back to visit family in pektah tikvah by joining left wing israelis returning from west bank demonstrations locals refer to the city as a bubble of tranquility amid a sea of unrest the pa maintains security coordination with israel which includes preemptively arresting would be palestinian terrorists who could attack israeli soldiers or civilians while efflal and i chat he pinches loose leaf tobacco creasing a paper to roll a crisp cigarette he puffs and talks without pause he wears a tattered plaid shirt with holes etched into the armpits he owns two or three shirts here the rest of his clothes are back on the kibbutz it takes approximately an hour and a half to bicycle from downtown jerusalem to the heart of ramallah the roads are primitive and the terrain is tricky efflal pedals in and out of ramallah by avoiding the main kalandiya checkpoint which separates jerusalem from the west bank instead he traverses checkpoints that are mostly for israeli settlers its easiest to cross from israel into palestinian area a on a bicycle he argues its a vehicle i dont need to park it doesnt have a license plate it just looks like this person cant do any harm the first time he came to ramallah he cycled through the main palestinian crossing at kalandiya when trekking back to jerusalem soldiers recognized his oversized bike the commander beckoned him to the pillbox we spoke a few words in hebrew he asked to see an id i told him i didnt have one because i entered ramallah with my foreign passport he looked at my bike looked at me and one of the soldiers told him that i had passed there two weeks ago before that so with an angry look on his face he told me to get the f out of here efflal was born in 1983 in kibbutz yiftah next to kiryat shmona and the lebanese border he recounted the security situation i grew up hearing gunshots and bombs on a regular basis all the time it was normal yet it still feels like a kibbutz it looks like a kibbutz and people act like it is efflal insists recounting the many volunteers who used to flock north even today he returns to the kibbutz shabbat dinner every two to three weeks hillel is the eldest with two brothers and a sister along with a half brother the two brothers live in jerusalem and his sister resides on the kibbutz hillels youngest brother a professional musician did not enlist in the idf his sister was a teacher in the army hillels parents sara hefrei efflal and boaz efflal are both retired from working on the kibbutz sara used to teach literature in high school and later published two novels and a compilation of short stories she served in the army as a sergeant boaz worked as a clerk and in insurance work around the kibbutz along with dabbling as a farmhand he served as a paratrooper in the six day and yom kippur wars through hillels childhood they kept an m16 in the house for kibbutz reserve duty saras family hails from hebron living there for at least six generations until the 1929 riots boaz is a typical yekke as his family all come from germany hillel attended elementary school in nearby kibbutz kfar blum for high school he attended three different schools in jerusalem he never got his diploma preferring to do his own thing he then trained for one year in practical and classical painting at the jerusalem studio school run by israel hershberg afterwards efflal chose not to serve in the idf he convinced the enlistment officer to let him off the hook by faking a hefty drug history i made it very clear to them that i dont get along with authority he said adding that few if any political motives were at play most of his close friends did not serve either both for ideological and personal reasons at age 21 efflal moved to new york city he initially sought to break into the citys hypercompetitive art world by painting nonstop but he became jaded with the business of gallery art eating crackers and drinking wine and socializing and then selling the painting for a price nobody could afford so he painted for himself he then worked under the table cooking and waitering overstaying his tourist visa for more than 10 years during his new york days efflal became passionate about cycling in his spare time he tinkers with bicycles he owns no vehicle preferring to bike wherever he may live an a political mural today as guests ascend the stairs to enter hostel in ramallah efflals oversized masterpiece comes into view inspired by old bezalel posters from the early 1930s the mural depicts seven windows to the west bank nablus bethlehem sebastiya a site of roman ruins jericho jerusalem al quds hebron and ramallah attempting to conjure a neutral almost biblical depiction of the west bank efflal sought to exclude modernist stylistic influences and opt for gentle symbolism in other words in an effort to avoid being overly political the murals symbolism seems obscured behind shapes and colors only well read observers can interpret the painters message efflal sought for his mural to bridge the gap between blunt symbolism and visual beauty even if it is a political piece it should contribute to the aesthetic value and serve to bring color and life to people walking down the street make peoples days a little more interesting when describing the mural efflal avoids the word palestine because that name has different meanings to different people he prefers west bank politics is a subject that he shies away from i dont think this is the best place to go into these things when cajoled the painter opens up but barely i dont see myself as a left activist as a peace activist he said in a humorously liberal attempt to evade labels even though i would be i guess classified as an extreme lefty in the israeli political spectrum i think im just a person as he sees it every side thinks my side is right he said adding its very important for your personal development to break bubbles break that spell and see from a bird eyes view breaking bubbles aside the mural is why he stayed in ramallah hostel owners chris alami and his brother muhab desired an entry mural they kvetched how they couldnt find someone suitable efflal overheard them and whipped out his portfolio a deal was struck room and board in exchange for a sweeping mural of palestine he finished the mural and is now looking to start on his next project painting political and commercial murals with the broken fingaz crew a collective of avant garde urban artists and aside from art efflal invites israelis to visit ramallah if you come here in civilian dress and with a certain humility and respect for the locals theres no real danger to you i think thats truly an act of peace it has nothing to do with politics its peace on the most real level one on one flouting convention and the law one artist finds inspiration across the green line
