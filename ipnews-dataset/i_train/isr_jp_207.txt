is too little attention better than too much on obama ignoring the israeli palestinian conflict in his speech at the united nations last year as he stood at the same podium obama assured the international community that as bleak as the landscape appeared to be in the middle east america would never give up the pursuit of peace between israelis and palestinians but during his 43 minute speech to the unga the president was silent on the matter awakening israeli fears that his attention will be elsewhere in the last year and a half of his presidency true these addresses are not a foolproof blueprint for future us foreign policy obama restored us cuba ties after 54 years without ever uttering a word about the island country during any of his last six speeches to the unga but when it comes to the israeli palestinian peace process obamas unga speeches have more or less mirrored american efforts on the ground to finalize a deal the time has come to re launch negotiations without preconditions that address the permanent status issues security for israelis and palestinians borders refugees and jerusalem obama said then and the goal is clear two states living side by side in peace and security a jewish state of israel with true security for all israelis and a viable independent palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and realizes the potential of the palestinian people he continued israel was mentioned 18 times more than any other nation and the palestinians were mentioned 15 times in contrast obama referenced iraq only four times iran twice and syria once out of all the global leaders prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas were the only ones he singled out by name the price of the conflict obama said as he waxed poetic is paid by the israeli girl in sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night its paid for by the palestinian boy in gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own these are all gods children and after all the politics and all the posturing this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security that is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of earth the holy land just two months later in an effort to help obama revitalize the peace process netanyahu imposed a 10 month moratorium on all building starts in west bank settlements it was the most significant crack down on jewish building in judea and samaria in the history of the settlement movement this month i am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between israelis and palestinians in washington sharm e sheikh and jerusalem obama told the unga then we all have a choice to make each of us must choose the path of peace of course that responsibility begins with the parties themselves who must answer the call of history now is the time to build the trust and provide the time for substantial progress to be made now is the time for this opportunity to be seized so that it does not slip away he said the president spoke strongly in support of israel as the homeland of the jewish people after 60 years in the community of nations israels existence must not be a subject for debate israel is a sovereign state and the historic homeland of the jewish people it should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at israels legitimacy will only be met by the unshakable opposition of the united states and efforts to threaten or kill israelis will do nothing to help the palestinian people the slaughter of innocent israelis is not resistance its injustice said obama this time we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see jerusalems soil as sacred this time we should reach for whats best within ourselves if we do when we come back here next year we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the united nations an independent sovereign state of palestine living in peace with israel i know particularly this week that for many in this hall theres one issue that stands as a test for these principles and a test for american foreign policy and that is the conflict between the israelis and the palestinians he mentioned the israelis and the palestinians 17 times each as opposed to syria which he mentioned nine times iraq four and iran three this time around however he did not name the israeli or palestinian leaders as he called on both sides to resume negotiations each side has legitimate aspirations and thats part of what makes peace so hard and the deadlock will only be broken when each side learns to stand in the others shoes each side can see the world through the others eyes thats what we should be encouraging thats what we should be promoting he said this body founded as it was out of the ashes of war and genocide dedicated as it is to the dignity of every single person must recognize the reality that is lived by both the palestinians and the israelis the measure of our actions must always be whether they advance the right of israeli and palestinian children to live lives of peace and security and dignity and opportunity obama said among israelis and palestinians the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict those who reject the right of israel to exist the road is hard but the destination is clear a secure jewish state of israel and an independent prosperous palestine understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties america will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey obama said earlier this year in jerusalem i was inspired by young israelis who stood up for the belief that peace was necessary just and possible said obama he continued that on the same trip i had the opportunity to meet with young palestinians in ramallah whose ambition and incredible potential are matched by the pain they feel in having no firm place in the community of nations obama said the time is now ripe for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace already israeli and palestinian leaders have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks president abbas has put aside efforts to short cut the pursuit of peace and come to the negotiating table prime minister netanyahu has released palestinian prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a palestinian state current talks are focused on final status issues of borders and security refugees and jerusalem so lets emerge from the familiar corners of blame and prejudice lets support israeli and palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk the difficult road to peace said obama now that the peace process is in a deep freeze the need for a resolution to the conflict will be raised at the unga this week by netanyahu and abbas but although us secretary of state john kerry plans to meet with netanyahu and the quartet intends to explore reviving the talks israelis and palestinians were not even mentioned in the obama speech which dealt with syria iran russia and isis israelis often worry about the disproportionate way the international community focuses on its conflict with the palestinians particularly at a time when hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in neighboring syria but now it seems that the only thing worse than too much attention is no attention at all
