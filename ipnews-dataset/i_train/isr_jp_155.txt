constant up and down in austrian israeli relations on april 22 sebastian kurz the youngest foreign minister in the world is going to arrive for a visit in israel the date could not be more symbolic with passover and mimouna just having passed the foreign minister stands for a new era new symbolism and a new tone between vienna and jerusalem for a long time a glass of water was the symbol for the ambivalence of israel toward austria in the year 1973 prime minister golda meir wanted to convince austrian chancellor bruno kreisky not to close the sch nau transit camp near baden in which thousands of soviet jews had their first experience with the west before transferring to israel israels current ambassador in vienna zvi heifetz went through this transit camp as well the background was an attack of palestinian terrorists in marchegg which ended without bloodshed because kreisky promised the closure of the camp golda meir made a pilgrimage to kreiskys villa and was given the cold shoulder i did not even get a glass of water she said in israel president shimon peres later denied the negative treatment in a book however golda meir insisted on her version shortly after in the fall of 1973 the yom kippur war broke out kreisky knew in advance of egyptian war plans but withheld the information from his israeli friends this added to the skepticism for the relations between austria and the state of the jews the jewish kreisky was a portent austrian president heinz fischer has always been kreiskys most faithful admirer and shares his political views on march 31 president shimon peres paid a state visit to vienna the oldest active president in the world and nobel peace laureate has been politically active since 1952 having held virtually every office in israeli politics a deep friendship connects peres with fischer as had previously been the case with the great humanist kreisky who as a critic of israel is with his anti semitic sayings if the jews are a people then a bad people admittedly rather controversial in israel kreisky made palestinian leader yasser arafat socially acceptable struggled and fought for peace in the middle east for the two state solution which has become a basic doctrine today kreiskys interior minister at that time karl blecha negotiated deals with terrorist groups and later interior minister erwin lanc enjoyed the company of right wing extremists such as martin hohmann who was excluded from the german center right christian democratic union cdu party when it comes to criticism of israel during the tenure of federal president kurt waldheim austrian israeli relations were in a trough federal chancellor franz vranitzky got austria out of its pariah status with a historic speech in 1991 austrias vote for the state of palestine at the un was a hint on the federal level israel seems to receive anti semitism from the right and the left the rightists love israel and hate the jews the leftists love the jews and hate israel for its policy was how an israeli diplomat put it but lately it happens indeed that an austrian foreign minister in discussions with jewish listeners is urged to push eastern neighbors to a greater awareness in dealing with the past this was what the flabbergasted former foreign and current minister of finance michael spindelegger got to hear in the synagogue of rabbi arthur schneier in new york could austria be an avant garde of memory ritualizing similar german israeli relations and seemingly being caught in their past in the 1950s at the beginning of these relations the emotions between vienna and jerusalem were a predominant part of diplomacy the holocaust seemed too recent and austria not ready to venture out of its victim role 5 700 pass sterreicher holder of austrian passports live in israel with ancestors and roots in the alpine republic the burden of austrias role in the nazi era seems to be no longer an issue for young israelis in israel memory has become an institution it is a reason for the state to lead thousands of young people to auschwitz every year young israelis with austrian backgrounds drink coffee from vienna eat mozartkugeln or fly to tyrol and salzburg to go skiing austrias current foreign minister sebastian kurz will seek to improve these relations during his imminent visit in israel as well it is again and again the nuances that dominate the navigation on the vienna jerusalem route thus for example the representation of the viennese jewish community when visiting jerusalem is going to be a bit more heavyweight than usual the visit is about austrias special responsibility toward its past as kurz stresses repeatedly this is all that austria currently has to offer a role as a mediator in the middle east conflict does not seem realistic austria would have an important intermediary role which kurz might occupy if he wants to live up to his dream role of becoming a great foreign minister a glance at the bumpy bilateral relations between the two countries on the occasion of the first visit of austrian foreign minister sebastian kurz
