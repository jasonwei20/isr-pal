fms peace blueprint proposes two largely homogeneous states in post op ed lieberman denies it would be illegal to remove israeli citizenship from arabs who found new borders had placed them in palestine arguing that history is moving away from attempts to accommodate competing national aspirations in a single state foreign minister avigdor lieberman on thursday issued a highly specific demand for an exchange of populated territories that would place many israeli arabs inside a new palestinian state he added those arabs who were in israel will now receive palestinian citizenship calling the article my blueprint for a resolution to the conflict the foreign minister wrote that the increasing pressure from the international community for israel to return to the pre 1967 armistice lines had no legal basis and that appeasing the maximalist territorial demands of the palestinians would not resolve the israeli palestinian conflict rather he wrote the conflict will inevitably pass beyond those borders and into israel essentially he elaborated the international community is pushing to create a homogeneous pure palestinian state and a bi national state in israel this becomes the one and a half to half state solution for lasting peace and security we need to create a true political division between arabs and jews with each enjoying self determination therefore for a lasting and fair solution lieberman added there needs to be an exchange of populated territories to create two largely homogeneous states one jewish israeli and the other arab palestinian of course this is not to preclude that minorities will remain in either state where they will receive full civil rights as for likely objections from the affected arabs lieberman wrote firstly we need to beg the question why arabs who claim to support palestinian national aspirations would reject this plan but ultimately he called for a referendum among all israelis to resolve the matter i believe that we can put this to a referendum including all of the citizens of israel and let them decide i have no doubt that the citizens of the state of israel regardless of race or religion will show political maturity to ensure a lasting peace which is in the best interests of all liebermans op ed article comes a day after he more vaguely urged kadima to accept the principle of trading territory and population as the solution to the palestinian issue and give up the principle of land for peace
