a qualitative difference for the democratic platform on the israeli palestinian conflict assessing the work of the platform drafting committee for the democratic national convention committee member and environmentalist activist bill mckibben astutely pointed out usually the platform is a document that i dont know how to say this politely is not well read and thats because usually theres been a clear consensus nominee and they basically put their stump speech into prose and there it is a platform this year its going to be more interesting and perhaps a kind of vehicle for bringing everybody together as we head toward the fall a critical area where the committee has an opportunity to make a difference is the role of the next administration in the israeli palestinian conflict whoever is president will focus on the core issues borders security refugees and jerusalem there is not much left to negotiate with these issues most have been discussed in the formal negotiations the geneva accords the pittsburgh process et cetera in many ways preventing an agreement from being reached are the issues under the table because they are the heart of the conflict these overlooked issues include emotion trauma responsibility cultural differences breaking down myths and related acknowledgment of and a better understanding of the other in so many ways those elements are the real issues until they are addressed any agreement will be much harder to reach and possibly will fail it cant be emphasized enough we need to turn concrete attention to them and the platform needs to signal this essential change this can be achieved with three tangible initiatives 1 we should encourage members of congress and other high level government officials to make site visits for example to the arava institute for environmental studies to remind people of its transformative work 2 the us should increase the funding it makes available to these organizations including support of the international fund of israeli palestinian peace to raise the profiles and influence of these organizations 3 we need to get away from looking at track 1 diplomacy as the only way to solve conflict there should be full track diplomacy which brings together track 1 track 2 and track 3 participants this conflict more than any calls out for that approach the use of these people to people israeli and palestinian ngos from track 2 diplomacy are essential for this shift us policy should include as advocated by liel maghen of the israel palestine center for research and information economic incentives for peace that will push more people to work together and help break down myths of the other as well as gain a better understanding of the other reduced to one of its core components this conflict is about land more precisely the borders that nations draw on the land when we look upon the land solely as a geopolitical instrument it is viewed as one of the major stumbling blocks to any reconciliation however when we view the land from an environmental perspective which does not know from political borders walls or fences a new framework opens up dr clive lipchin of the arava institute has pointed out the need to look at watersheds rather than political borders this has led to work between palestinians and israelis in the besor hebron beersheba watershed and similar ideas when it comes to the jordan river watershed the us should also consider a social media campaign that clearly denounces violence and promotes a two state solution edward hall talks about high context and low context cultures how people of differing cultures communicate and express themselves in ways that people of other cultures can easily misinterpret in halls rubric israel is low context and the palestinians are high context in his astute book culture and conflict in egyptian israeli relations a dialogue of the deaf raymond cohen makes that point when it comes to israelis and egyptians and by extension to israelis and palestinians this is an area where the us needs to be more effective in translating and defining not only words but also the cultural nuances at those moments when both sides talk past each other through their expressive cultural differences mckibben also said so lets hope this one reads differently than the last time around because the worlds a different place than it was four years ago if the platform committee addresses the too long overlooked issues of the palestinian israeli conflict the platform will have a chance to send a qualitatively different message than previous platforms and make a difference the author a rabbi teaches conflict resolution at bennington colleges center for the advancement of public action
