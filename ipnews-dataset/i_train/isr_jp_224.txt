a judenrein palestine this week sources close to prime minister binyamin netanyahu sparked controversy when they announced that in any future palestinian state israel would insist that israelis living in judea and samaria be allowed to remain under palestinian control if they should choose to coalition partners even members of netanyahus own party were quick to reject the idea palestinians were no less adamant in their opposition to allowing jewish settlements to remain in any future two state solution anyone who says he wants to keep the settlers in a palestinian state is really saying he does not want a palestinian state chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat declared no settler will be permitted to stay in a palestinian state not one because the settlements are illegal and the presence of settlers on occupied lands is illegal however one month before while in egypt and speaking in arabic abbas said something very different in a final resolution we would not see the presence of a single israeli civilian or soldier on our land other palestinians have made a distinction between existing settlements which would have to go and future jewish immigration to palestine which would be allowed they have done this to counter the argument that palestinians are trying to make judea and samaria areas so resonant with historical and religious meaning for jews the only place in the world that is officially judenrein cleansed of jews all supporters of a two state solution would ideally like to see a palestinian state created alongside israel that is pluralistic enough and democratic enough to incorporate a jewish minority just as the state of israel is able to incorporate a large arab minority such a palestinian state would be more stable and peaceful than an autocracy or an islamic republic which seem to be the norms in the region unfortunately this is not the situation any israeli left behind under palestinian sovereignty would likely be in danger some such as mk hilik bar labor chairman of the knesset caucus to resolve the arab israel conflict argue that under conditions of peace palestinians would work hard to ensure the security of israelis who would remain they would do this to prove that a palestinian state is capable of protecting all citizens bar claims but we cannot rely on such optimistic forecasts the question is whether the two state solution will remain feasible even if israel is forced to evacuate tens of thousands of settlers many of whom include the most ideologically opposed to territorial compromise while the majority remains in large settlement blocs that will be annexed to israel ensuring a strong jewish majority dictates the need to support a two state solution but at what price therein lies the paradox if the palestinians were truly interested in peace they should be able to absorb a jewish minority if on the other hand the palestinians are unwilling to integrate jews perhaps they are truly not interested in peace under the circumstances it will be no easy matter to convince a majority of israelis that the price of a two state solution is worth it
