president obama it is now the time for palestine the deal with iran or the joint comprehensive plan of action signed in vienna on july 14 is a done deal this continues to amaze people in washington d c as well as globally considering it was just eight months ago that candidates running for the senate and congress asked obamas team for the president to refrain from publicly endorsing them let alone join their canvassing efforts now hillary clinton endorses the deal with iran and her campaign policy chief jake sullivan adds how central clinton was to building the coalition and starting the diplomacy that resulted in what happened today running for the party leadership and countrys presidency to her left senator bernie sanders naturally hailed the iran pact as a victory for democracy it is not that the pact isnt controversial but rather obamas recent record on various issues has made his presidency a source for pride in a rapidly globalizing and multipolar world with an america that faces deep social divisions and an economy burdened by unprecedented debt it would have been difficult for any president to advance his foreign and domestic policies for obama having lost control over both the congress and the senate at the end of last year its been even more of a challenge not to spend his remaining time in office as a lame duck with a series of rulings outside of the senate and congress by the executive branch state legislatures as well as in the supreme court president obama is on a roll the israeli palestinian conflict has been on obamas agenda from his first day in office while its difficult to be certain it seems the presidents efforts to broker a deal have stemmed from a deep sense of justice sure he needed to justify his early winning of a noble peace prize entering the lions den of middle east diplomacy was also in the interest of his ally israel as well as that of his own country nevertheless he also seems to have been motivated by a genuine commitment to justice it is that universal commitment which gives america the moral legitimacy to meddle so deeply in the conflict between two peoples living some 9 000 km away from its capital it is also that commitment which made an american president prefer talking to thousands of israeli students at the human level reminidng them that their ability to make their own decisions to get an education and a good job to worship god in their own way to get married and have a family should be shared also by the young palestinians he met in ramallah and by young palestinians who yearn for a better life in gaza as obama said in an interview for israels channel 2 last month it does not seem likely that even a framework agreement will be possible during his presidency gazas hamas is an internationally recognized terrorist organization palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas in the west bank has lost all democratic legitimacy and prime minister benjamin netanyahu is well netanyahu nevertheless in the absence of progress regression is still very possible another war with gaza is only a matter of time abbas is 80 years old and a heavy smoker and his departure could transform the entire palestinian national struggle for statehood into a campaign for civil rights in israel and netanyahus government often acts like a puppet of the settlers lobby it is therefore not a surprise that popular support for the two state solution is dwindling as demonstrated in a june poll by the hebrew university and the palestinian center for policy research it is too easy to classify and dismiss any action by the international community as delegalization of the state of israel an alternative perspective to that of the government distinguishes international actions to build israel and palestine from those that seek to hurt either side while boycotts and sanctions often aggravate the politics and always hurt the livelihood of ordinary citizens declarative and symbolic acts of recognition are completely in line with the do no harm principle in fact they are imperative for those who view support for israel a two state solution and justice as complementary rather than contradictory it is from that perspective that over 1 000 israeli dignitaries published a call to the un security council to admit palestine into the organization and following the recent deal with iran the policy committee of the israeli peace ngo forum called upon the government of israel the united states and all arab and muslim states to adopt a similar diplomatic approach and determined strategy towards a resolution of the israeli palestinian conflict president obama will rightly refrain from pushing for another round of peace talks but his foreign policy legacy can still present a breakthrough in the dangerous impasse between israel and palestine an american yes vote or at least no veto on a forthcoming initiative for palestinian statehood at the un security council will not make obama any more popular in the israeli prime ministers office but neither will it hurt a single hair of any israeli citizen on the contrary it may help strengthen the moderates who still support a two state solution at both the grassroots and the elite level american israeli relations will remain strong as they did following fords reassessment carters push for a withdrawal from sinai reagans recognition of the plo bush 41s middle east peace conference in madrid clintons parameters bush 43s roadmap including a call to freeze all settlement activity and ending the occupation that began in 1967 and indeed obamas own turbulent relationship with netanyahu at the twilight of his presidency obama must not condition his vision with procedures like bilateral peace talks which both israeli and palestinian leaderships failed at in the past it is now the time for great decisions which will in the long term benefit israel too as martin luther king jr once put it in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends at the un dont be silent say yes to the state of palestine the author is a phd candidate and a member of the policy committee of the israeli
