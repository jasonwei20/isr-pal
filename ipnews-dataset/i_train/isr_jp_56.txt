from western wall crisis to israel palestine now the crisis over the western wall has now broadened to an overall analysis of israeli diaspora relations and here are some thoughts for many liberal american jews it becomes harder to be as self righteous in criticizing israeli rightist politics now that we americans also have president donald trump our own surging alt right government and also a rogue fringe right and moreover so many entrenched pathologies like our gun obsession that it seems we cant do anything more about than israel can about its problems but it still seems that american liberal jews are justified in criticizing israels right when we consider that israel has had its trump government for so long that its the second longest running in israels history while ours is only of recent date and even then trump lost the popular vote and so we feel that ours could be temporary while israels trump right could outlive both us in america and also israelis and further outlive israelis children and their childrens children and we american jewish liberals are at least trying to fight hard against our alt right and our societys pathologies while it would appear that many on the israeli right are intensively supporting and worsening their own pathologies also american liberal jews point out that in america with our rightist gun madness and other rightist and supremacist extremisms we are fighting against american rightists are only hurting us americans israel on the other hand is also hurting another people with its endless occupation its settlement movements maximalist and annexationist claims and the countrys endless invasive and intrusive acts including settlement expansionism on occupied and incrementally stolen palestinian land of course just as the american right is doing to america the israeli right is harming israel itself it is harming its own country by making israel increasingly vulnerable to something many of its own prime ministers ehud barak ehud olmert yitzhak rabin and founder david ben gurion himself have warned about prospective apartheid in the occupied territories and the resulting existential danger to israel of self dissolution into a religiously indistinct binational state and it is hurting israel by creating many new laws against israelis and jews basic democratic political rights to undertake peaceful political actions against the threats the occupation and settlements pose to israel as a jewish state new laws that threaten israels own democracy and jewishness in addition to the rights and sovereignty and basic political independence of the palestinian other people israel occupies needless to say israel is also under more and almost daily threats and acts of violence and these do deserve emphasis and to be underscored they deserve the opposite of any excuse making or any minimization in any way shape or form and thus to sharply reduce both the threats against yourselves and the harm you do to others to increase the likelihood of security and dignity and rights for israel and palestine like both sides have been plentifully at fault of course and we liberal jewish americas do wish palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas had taken up olmerts own major peace overture and strongly condemn him for not doing it less spoken of is this one of the main bewilderments of so many american jewish liberals involves our liberal israeli friends and allies they sometimes seem to go so far as to praise israel and it is certainly a most admirable and in many ways actually miraculous as to overlook or understate its problems this is even though as clear sighted realistic liberals they understand that the countrys interminable and perhaps trumpist government of self harm oppression of others and protracted crisis as long as the trumpist government remains in power make it hard to see how the countrys crisis could ever end rather than only get worse it could get worse for both the palestinians who are in wretched conditions in the first place and for the israelis because the major gains and strides israel has so admirably made in its own social and economic conditions have also have paradoxically given them so much more than the palestinians to recklessly mishandle and lose it has given them so much more to lose through their interminable and ever more aggressive more far fetched and more ultra rightist annexationist claims and accompanying on the ground actions advancing the oppression of another people and now even in israel itself israel inflicts self harm by all the new normal pushes in legislative and undemocratic restrictions against its own citizens and other well wishing jews critical statements actions against policies which they believe to be highly self destructive for american jewish liberal warm and equal well wishers of israel and the palestinians it seems more and more like an unending hopeless and worsening tragedy in which it is hard to see how for either side this can escape becoming ultimately irreversible if all this can be reversed and hopefully it can it would nonetheless be interesting to learn precisely how the
