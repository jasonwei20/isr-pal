israeli history its all in the cards no matter how old or young you happen to be it is almost certain that greeting cards have been a part of your life these little paper works of art signed sealed in little envelopes and sent through the mail have probably heralded all of the milestones of your life as well as the holidays occurring throughout each of your years even today as paper gives way to email e cards twitter tweets and greetings from friends on facebook most people still perk up when an actual greeting card lands in the mailbox everyone likes them but few people spend much time thinking about greeting cards in the abstract as a piece of cultural history caught on a little piece of paper historians say that the first to send them were the ancient egyptians who exchanged written greetings on strips of papyrus the chinese as might be expected were also early senders of greeting cards as part of their annual celebration of the chinese new year according to tel aviv university historian haim grossman the jews of medieval germany began the custom of sending out greeting cards in the weeks leading up to the jewish new year these shana tova cards were handmade and hand delivered and became more ornate and artistic during the succeeding centuries which also saw the introduction of printing and lithography by the late 19th century thanks to advances in printing and lower postal rates due to the introduction of the postage stamp a costly handmade gift became an inexpensive widely available form of communication the making and sending of new year cards spread from central to eastern europe and then to the united states and israel these cards usually featured pictures of jewish people and jewish life in europe the us mandate palestine and the state of israel a careful look at these cards from over the past 100 years and from the various places that jews have lived tell us a lot more than just happy new year a fascinating exhibition of jewish new year greeting cards is currently on display at the haifa city museum through more than 400 cards on display we are able to see in miniature the cultural history of the jews of europe the us and especially israel since the late 19th century the exhibition called shanot tovot is the brainchild of inbar dror lax the museums curator and chief creative force lax 35 who has been curator of the haifa city museum for just a little over a year sees no contradiction between mounting a broad jewish and israeli cultural exhibition in a museum dedicated to the history of haifa this is part of my program at the museum to show part of the cultural heritage of israel and the jewish people she says the primary role of the haifa museum is to deal with the history of haifa but haifa is really a microcosm of israel and israeli society i think that there are a lot of things that we can see in israeli society that have passed through haifa or were born in haifa so when we started to do the exhibition on the shana tova cards we started with materials from haifa but quickly decided not to just settle for the materials we had from haifa and just tell a haifa story but to tell a broader story and what kind of story do the greetings cards tell starting with 19th century germany we see scenes of very formal looking german jewish families dressed in the fashionable clothing of the day and obviously trying to integrate with german society at large the families sit or stand stiffly around a holiday table but they are dressed like the non jewish bourgeois world outside their home other cards from germany at this time feature scenes depicting israel but without even a scintilla of zionism israel is depicted as the holy land with scenes from biblical places like rachels tomb or contemporary views of places like jaffa exotic and strikingly oriental with plenty of arabs and camels as the custom of sending new year cards spreads to eastern europe the scenes change abruptly to traditional depictions of hassidic men and boys on their way to synagogue overtly traditional families celebrating the holiday around the dining table rabbis blowing shofarot and men performing the ritual of kapparot in preparation for yom kippur the scenes are usually painted images but there are also photographs many of them retouched by hand to look like paintings we pause for a moment to ask lax who these greeting card artists were they were not famous she replies the idea was that they were not supposed to be famous because this is not fine art they werent painters they were illustrators they werent artists they were craftsmen the printers became better known than any of the artists they didnt even sign their work and it would seem they never got any of the respect or recognition they were due the exhibitions center of gravity shifts almost completely to mandate palestine as we reach the 1930s the cards produced simply and usually composed of black and white photographs depict the growing yishuv we see the sabra persona being developed in these pictures of robust men and women looking defiantly modern uncomplicated and relieved of the burden of having to fit into urban european society and while we still see images of sites like rachels tomb and davids tower we also see often in the same card views of the habimah theater the broad bauhaus boulevards of tel aviv haifa port kibbutz agriculture plenty of tractors and healthy suntanned children marching with the israeli flag zionism becomes what lax calls a civil religion as we move into the immediate post independence era the victorious israeli army becomes a major motif of new year cards as does the israeli flag figures like theodor herzl and chaim weizmann appear often depicted in ways that might have embarrassed the actual men lax points to an image of weizmann and says theyve painted him so that he almost looks like lenin the cards become more colorful as we move through the 1950s and into the 1960s says lax and look whats happening to the cards we have more money now so the cards are bigger and shinier and more colorful and the scenes they depict begin to look a lot like america nice families in suburban homes with big cars this is how they wanted to see themselves now with american looking houses and big shiny cars the cars indeed look a lot like mid 1960s lincoln continentals the heroic idf becomes a major theme for new year cards following the six day war of 1967 through the 1973 war and into the middle of the decade tanks and columns of marching soldiers roll across the cards as airplanes fly majestically overheard other scenes portray young soldiers male and female standing tall and proud in their uniforms gazing into the distance with what appears to be unshakeable confidence and optimism as we move to the final leg of the exhibition encompassing the late 1970s to the present day we are shocked to see the extent to which israel all but disappears from israeli new year cards we see families composed of people photographed overseas not israeli and probably not jewish the cards say shana tova but the people depicted in them somehow do not in addition we see israeli new year cards featuring such figures as donald and daisy duck mickey and minnie mouse as well as snow white and prince charming where has israel gone we can see how society changed from the beginning of the cards we can understand the way we see ourselves through the cards and what happened to the zionist dream the dream seems to be gone says lax as we wend our way through the exhibition we ultimately see a constant conflict raging within us to arrive at an identity a self image a way to present ourselves to ourselves and to the rest of the world we can see our people asking themselves who do we want to be what do we want to be traditional jews modern citizens in our countries of residence farmers in the holy land or warriors in the new state of israel or do we simply want to live like americans complete with split level suburban homes big cars and mickey mouse over 100 years of this identity conflict is captured on cards right here in this ambitious and absorbing exhibition shanot tovot is showing until january 31 at the haifa city museum 11 ben gurion avenue haifa tel 04 911 5888 through more than 400 new year cards on display at haifa city museum we are able to see in miniature the cultural history of the jews of europe the us and israel since the late 19th century
