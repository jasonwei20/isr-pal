round 2 of israel and palestine at the icc if the pa obtains non member nation status at the un it may again try to prosecute the jewish state israels win was on a technicality though not a small one according to the rome statute governing the icc cases can only be filed with the court by referral from the un security council or by a state there is a third path that the court appears to be applying in the case of kenya but for various reasons no one has made or is likely to make a serious push to use that exception on behalf of the palestinians the technical problem the palestinians had and have at least for another two weeks is that israel argued the palestinians were not a state therefore israel argued the palestinians did not have standing or authority to file a case with the icc in other words the icc could not even start looking into the merits of individual cases after more than three years debating the issue including soliciting around a dozen legal opinions from governments academics and interested parties across the spectrum the icc prosecutor luis moreno ocampo took israels side and said that the pa could not file cases with him because at the time there was no state called palestine had the decision gone the other way the fact that palestine would only have become a state party to the icc even years after the cast lead offensive against hamas would have been irrelevant in the media the decision was reported as an unequivocal win for israel and the palestinians were openly disappointed having thought from the three year process their success in gaining membership in unesco and the solicitations of legal briefs on the issue that they had a solid chance of winning one would have thought that israels foreign ministry would have had a public celebration after saving the nations soldiers and leaders from prosecution instead the ministrys reaction was unexpectedly muted merely noting as opposed to at least noting with satisfaction moreno ocampos decision and expressed in diplomatic speak disagreement with part of it saying israel had reservations regarding some of the legal pronouncements and assumptions why would israel have reservations about a decision closing the door to pa war crimes cases it turns out that moreno ocampo closed the door but left it ajar for a round 2 first in most of his decision he focused on the un general assembly as the decisive organization for defining who is a state for the purposes of filing a case with the icc this is crucial because he could have focused on the security council the body that must approve any country to become a member of the un the us has pledged to veto any vote in the un security council declaring palestine a member state making that a dead end thus moreno ocampos focus on the general assembly gave the pa a future opening for an end run on being able to file war crimes cases with the icc by getting recognized as a non member state without security council recognition but with general assembly recognition moreno ocampo even almost told the palestinians what road to go down to beat the jurisdictional problem remarking that palestines status was only as an observer and not a non member state as if to suggest to the pa that if they had been a non member state already his decision might have been different finally moreno ocampo said that his office could reconsider the allegations of crimes in palestine in the future should competent organs of the un give him direction that the statehood problem was resolved he also mentioned the assembly of state parties the parliament and governing body of the icc as being empowered to accept palestine as a state but procedurally that could be much harder than a simple up or down vote in the un general assembly in essence moreno ocampo said that if the pa gets voted as a non member state by the un general assembly in two weeks it can try again to re file the war crimes cases some commentators have said that moreno ocampos advice to the palestinians was non binding that the only relevant part of his decision was his ruling that the pa was not a state and that without un security council approval a political vote alone from the un general assembly will leave the pa at the same dead end of still not being seen as a state by the icc besides statehood there are still plenty of question marks and other obstacles while some felt that moreno ocampo would have liked to have filed cases against israel if his hands had not been tied there is less known about bensouda and whether she would take the same stance as her predecessor in a relatively new office with little precedent for how to operate also in theory if the palestinians risk filing with the icc israel though currently not a party to the icc and others might also file against them for human rights violations also as a new institution diplomatic pressure from the us though not a party to the rome statute and from some european states could delay or stop a case from moving forward even if the initial jurisdictional problem was cured further israel is not a party to the rome statute so it could be difficult or impossible to actually conduct a case against israels citizens without its governments cooperation finally it is far from clear that the icc would make a final decision to indict any israelis in light of the fact that israel has completed a process of investigations including some prosecutions of its soldiers actions in operation cast lead generally speaking the icc is only supposed to make a final decision to file indictments if the state of the accused citizens has done nothing to investigate the allegations many argue that only credible investigations are required not convictions despite all of these question marks there is no question that a vote recognizing palestine as a non member state in two weeks would start a round 2 on the war crimes allegations relating to operation cast lead
