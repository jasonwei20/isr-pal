roger waters shouldnt silence israeli artists in it waters attacks efforts to combat the anti israel boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign describing it as a form of censorship while continuing his irresponsible use of incendiary terms like mccarthyite blacklisting and authoritarian as an outspoken supporter of the most egregious aspects and actions of the bds movement waters has no business taking a moral stand on free speech bds is a campaign whose primary weapon is censorship and whose activists put considerable energy into silencing israeli artists as well as international artists who schedule shows in express support for or even simply visit israel bds activists have sent death threats to artists scheduled to perform in israel including salif keita and paul mccartney they along with the rolling stones radiohead santana elton john justin bieber lady gaga rod stewart madonna guns n roses regina spektor chainsmokers pixies and rihanna instead enthusiastically performed in defiance of bds demands that they cancel their tours bds activists continue to urge governments to ban films made by or starring israelis this past summer a bds campaign contributed to lebanon jordan tunisia and algeria all banning the international blockbuster wonder woman due to the leading role of zionist actress gal gadot its easy to try to dismiss these incidents as outliers but to do so would be disingenuous on a daily basis bds barrages international artists with misinformation in an effort to pressure them to cancel their shows in israel and attempts to smear their reputation when they refuse it bullies and threaten palestinians who want to cooperate and engage in dialogue with israelis bds is committed to silencing israelis and isolating israel to show the world a black and white narrative where only one side the anti israel side is represented in other words bds activists such as roger waters supporters of a movement that calculatedly tramples on freedom of expression should not be taking a moral stand on free speech while simultaneously orchestrating campaigns to destroy it this is hypocrisy at its most blatant and dangerous despite waters attempts to characterize bds as human rights activists it has become increasingly clear that it is instead a band of bullies aimed at dismantling israel in fact bds co founder omar barghouti has said definitely most definitely we oppose a jewish state in any part of palestine referring to all of israel he reiterated that if all of bds demands were met you would have a palestine next to a palestine rather than a palestine next to israel finally waters blasts the anti boycott act as serious lawfare insists it threatens all those who believe in universal human rights and the first amendment and histrionically rails that it promises felony arrests from archbishops to altar boys this is taking fear mongering to a whole new level the fact is that existing federal law has long banned participation in boycotts of friendly nations and that there is zero language in the current act that would forbid anti israel activists from ever expressing support for boycotts we at creative community for peace ccfp and our colleagues throughout the entertainment industry who believe in the power of the arts to further peace continue to hope that roger waters will reconsider this campaign of destructive misinformation and damaging rhetoric rather than demonizing colleagues and demanding prejudicial boycotts we invite him to instead use his considerable voice and join us in building bridges between israelis and palestinians david renzer is co founder of creative community for peace chairman spirit music group steve schnur is co founder of ccfp and worldwide head of music at electronic arts
