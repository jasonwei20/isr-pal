the insider origins of anti israelism every week brings news of a controversy involving an ostensibly jewish or israeli institution playing host to radical anti zionism anti israelism or even anti semitism for instance a week ago it was revealed that a montreal jewish festival had disinvited a noted anti birthright activist named sarah woolf at limmud in south africa earlier this year there was some debate over the anti jnf film village under the forest there was controversy over a conference for the palestinian right of return being hosted at the eretz israel museum the narrative we are presented with each time is that this is surprising or ironic supposedly a jewish community center israeli cultural event or israeli museum serving as a venue for people who think the state of israel should be dismantled or radically altered is a contradiction in terms however radical critique of israel is not an outsider phenomenon while it may be a minority voice that minority is often the elite of the jewish and israeli community they are outside insiders those masquerading as outsider critics but who in fact were groomed by and recognized as part of the elite zionist structure the inside outsider was used by jeremy suri to describe henry kissinger an outsider as an immigrant who became an inside player in us administration he gave an interview to haaretz in which he advised israelis to obtain foreign passorts and said the law of return that allows jews to immigrate to israel should be cancelled he was celebrated abroad in the independent the new york times and elsewhere as a daring apostate zeev bielski the chairman of the jewish agency responded that burgs statements caused him pain over a person who was considered to have great promise for the future of the state of israel pain over a person raised and educated in this country in a jewish zionist family one of the leaders of israels younger generation burg has since been on speaking tours and on november 11 was at harvards quincy house giving the samuel l and jodidi lecture at the weatheread center for an apostate hes done quite well for himself burgs narrative of growing up in a traditional zionist home and then becoming a critic isnt the exception it is the rule alon liel former foreign ministry director general claimed in a february conference that in the situation that exists today until a palestinian state is created we are actually one state this joint state in the hope that the status quo is temporary is an apartheid state his comments were greeted with shock he told his listeners as someone who knows the original apartheid well and also knows the state of israel quite well i was born here grew up here served and fought for it for 30 years someone like me knows that zionism isnt apartheid and the state of israel that i grew up in wasnt an apartheid state similarly burg claimed my generation born in the 50s back then americans and israelis talked about democracy human rights respect for other nations and human solidarity it was an age of dreamers and builders who sought to create a new world one without prejudice racism or discrimination where is that righteous america whatever happened to the good old israel miko peled peddles his insider status as a key to his identity in his book the generals son journey of an israeli in palestine it was 1948 in jerusalem and zika katsnelson peled my mother was 22 years old she was a daughter of the zionist elite her father dr avraham katsnelson was a member of the provisional zionist government in palestine and later a signatory of israels declaration of independence his father was the israeli general matti peled mikos sister nurit peled elhanan was quoted at mondoweiss as saying apartheid in israel and palestine imposed and practised by the israeli security forces is enabled by the most profound racism practised every day in every domain of life it is a mistake to pretend that these are outsider opinions they were generated and sculpted by the very leaders and founders of zionism by israeli generals and a family that signed the declaration of independence these views didnt just come out of nowhere either they formed over time in coffee houses and in the homes of the elites on the kibbutzim and in the universities opposition to zionism is in fact a central feature of zionism opposition to and daring criticism of the state of israel is integral to being an insider in israel abdul kareem a commenter at the website of americans for middle east understanding notes i found it hard to believe that miko coming from such a background could present such a moral story but karim misunderstands the source and nature of these views they do not contrast with the background they are rooted deeply in it many other radical critics like oren yiftachel who compares jewish communities in israel to pure white settler states like australia and canada proudly describes being raised on a kibbutz in a northern israeli kibbutz where socialism was not a curse and social justice was not a mere theory meron benvenisiti another critic was the deputy mayor of jerusalem dror feiler emigrated to sweden in the 1970s and renounced his citizenship he was on the gaza flotilla but in a recent article it is revealed his mother was a founder of kibbutz yad hana in fact most of the leaders of israeli anti israel ngos the radical critics who shout apartheid or go on speaking tours of the us such as the recent one by breaking the silence at harvard university are composed of those raised on kibbutz or traditional zionist families they attended the best israeli high schools and universities they pose as outsiders but are the ultimate insiders to list them all would take too long but all you have to do is ask the next time you hear about some radical israel critic where did he or she grow up you will find that most probably they or their parents were generals leading academics director generals of ministries or bureaucrats in various state funded institutions the same holds true in the diaspora most of the radical critics are insiders a new film being shown by the ngo zochrot includes the biography of alice rothchild an american jew raised on the tragedies of the holocaust and the dream of a jewish homeland in israel the film follows my personal journey as i begin to understand the palestinian narrative peter beinart when he wrote about closing his blog open zion describes the careers of many of his employees our first employee elisheva goldberg was a high school aipac activist transformed by meeting palestinians while studying at yeshiva in the west bank the fact is that anti zionism and critique of israel are the ultimate insiders career path those insiders who become anti zionist or radical critics rarely offer constructive criticism and this differentiates them from the descendants of other founding generations the founders of the american republic didnt turn on that republic in a generation and go on speaking tours condemning it critics of israeli policy could be constructive a solution to the conflict with the palestinians is in everyones interest and combating racism is a good thing but the way in which many of these insiders go about it becoming more famous at harvard and in london than they are in israel seems counterproductive to say the least bashing israel as a racist failed state in boston or berlin doesnt make anyone less racist in israel responsible insiders work for change from within but unfortunately the jewish community and israel is not cultivating a responsible elite culture of critique but an irresponsible one
