a chair s reserved for the p l o shockingly derailed by the hebron massacre the middle east peace talks seem to be on track again although israel may have to walk a few extra yards before the palestine liberation organization goes along the key was a long delayed security council resolution voted on friday condemning the feb 25 killing of 29 muslim worshipers by a jewish settler with that the united states announced that syria jordan and lebanon had agreed to restart their separate talks with israel in april and that the israelis and the p l o would try to pick up their own thread once more an israeli delegation will go to p l o headquarters in tunis today to discuss post massacre security arrangements but that doesn t mean all sides can now put the hebron trauma behind them getting the three arab states back to the bargaining table is important but the p l o is the real issue most likely it will return as well to mop up remaining security and economic matters so that palestinian self rule can begin in gaza and jericho but if the p l o continues to balk it is hard to see much progress on any front the reality is that palestinians are still angry about hebron and so the politically vulnerable p l o is holding out for israeli concessions beyond an ongoing crackdown on radical settlers including the outlawing last week of the anti arab kach and kahane chai movements israel suggests it may accept a palestinian police force in hebron under israeli control its leaders also toss out hints about moving the 450 jews from that flashpoint west bank town but they have limits too and warn that nothing will happen until the p l o first resumes talks many israelis note that they have not let palestinian terrorism interrupt negotiations now they say it is the palestinians turn to rise above raw emotions
