the fatal israeli gaza mistakes israels first major mistake in this context concerns the gaza disengagement prime minister ariel sharons decision to disengage unilaterally and not as part of an agreement with the pa led directly to the election of hamas sharon called palestinian president mahmoud abbas a chick without feathers and declared that he was not a partner and that was after abbas inherited the palestinian leadership following the death of yasser arafat abbas became president with an electoral victory of 63 on a ticket which campaigned against the militarization of the conflict with israel against the second intifada and against terrorism abbas was committed to rebuilding the pa based on the bush administrations road map which included dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism the international community appointed former world bank president dr james wolfensohn as a special envoy to coordinate israels disengagement from gaza and to help ensure its economic success the pa created 12 technical committees to coordinate disengagement with israel under the direction of then national security adviser muhammad dahlan nonetheless sharon refused to coordinate the disengagement with the palestinians the palestinian technical committees remained orphans israel decided to demolish all of the israeli settlements in gaza rather than leaving them for the pa to house refugees the pa had begun planning a raffle among gazas poorest to get a jump start on a new beginning a very senior official in sharons office told me off the record that sharons intention was that the palestinians would fail in taking over gaza and international pressure on israel to withdraw from the west bank would be significantly lessened that is in fact what happened the classic example given of the pas failure in running the affairs of gaza is the hothouses that produced 250 million of income when israel was running the show and went bankrupt after two seasons of pa management the truth of the matter is of the 5 000 sq m of hothouses that existed in gush katif about 500 were dismantled by settlers themselves another 500 were dismantled by palestinian vandalism before the pa security forces took over the area four thousand square meters of hothouses were put under the management of a private palestinian company established for this purpose that employed the very same workers and technologies used by the settlers but after the disengagement israel closed the borders and the goods rotted before ever getting to the israeli markets during the first 100 days after disengagement the border crossing to israel was open 17 days israel then devised its failed policy of isolation of gaza under the premise that engagement with the pa under the leadership of prime minister salam fayyad in the west bank would create a new economic and political reality which would clearly demonstrate that supporting peace and moderation would pay off while at the same time by leaving hamas in power in gaza the people of gaza would suffer and understand that they needed to get rid of the organization only the shift to a positive reality in the west bank was very slow and very non strategic and the harshness of the closure of gaza angered palestinians in gaza and the west bank as well as other nations of the world especially in the middle east when it became clear that the israeli policies were limiting the importation of basic foods into gaza calculated on an average needed intake of calories people were furious at israel not hamas support for hamas increased and anger against the pa that was cooperating with israel also increased and then came cast lead to be continued next week the author is the founder and co chairman of ipcri israel palestine creative regional initiatives www ipcri org
