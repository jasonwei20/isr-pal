israeli peace advocate ends hunger strike after 40 days without even a bite of food abie nathan the peace advocate ended his hunger strike today without achieving any of his goals i didn t fast to die mr nathan said as he accepted president chaim herzog s plea to begin eating again i want to live and make it possible for others to live too mr nathan who is 64 years old began his fast on march 25 with the goal of forcing the government to repeal the law forbidding israelis to meet with members of the palestine liberation organization his larger purpose he said was to push israel to make peace with the arabs parliament briefly debated an amendment that would have loosened the law forbidding contacts with the p l o but the proposal was soundly defeated as mr nathan ended his fast after losing about 50 pounds he said he had accomplished something a few days ago i started feeling the waves of sympathy i triggered he said i saw people willing to go on fighting my war with me that i would not be alone this gave me the feeling that the time had come
