ethnic cleansing and apartheid palestine nearly 15 years ago a tall lanky legislator from massachusetts arose in the us senate and delivered a brief yet impassioned call to stop what was deemed to be ethnic cleansing in the balkans with a concurrent resolution on the table authorizing us president bill clinton to launch air operations and missile strikes against yugoslavia the lawmaker turned to his wavering colleagues and implored them to vote in favor the essential objective he said according to the march 23 1999 congressional record is to minimize the capacity for ethnic cleansing that is the overpowering strategic and i think also humanitarian interest here the veteran senators words and his emphasis on the need to stop ethnic cleansing helped to carry the day with the senate voting to pass the non binding resolution by a margin of 58 41 the following day nato with american participation launched a ruthless and bloody bombing campaign against belgrade by pushing for the establishment of a palestinian state in judea and samaria kerry is effectively calling for the systematic and compulsory removal of a particular religious and ethnic group in this case jews from their homes he is attempting to lend a hand to palestinian efforts to remove any and all jews from their midst for the simple reason that they are jews isnt that precisely what ethnic cleansing is all about at his press conference in davos on friday prime minister binyamin netanyahu rightly repudiated this contemptible stance i have no intention of removing a single community the premier said adding i have no intention of uprooting a single israeli in the wake of netanyahus remarks an unnamed source in the prime ministers office suggested that israeli residents of judea and samaria should be allowed to remain in areas under palestinian control as part of any peace deal naturally the palestinians wasted little time in reacting with palestinian authority negotiator saeb erekat telling the associated press that no settler will be allowed to stay in the palestinian state not even a single one in other words the palestinians are ready to hang a large no jews allowed sign at the entrance to their sought after country in this regard netanyahu has adeptly exposed the true face of palestinian nationalism after all the palestinian desire to create a monolithic entity one that is free of jews belies their claim to democratic aspirations and reveals the hatred and intolerance that is lurking in their hearts if the very idea of jews living among them is unacceptable what does that say about the kind of state palestine would be we all know the answer to this question any palestinian state that would arise would be yet another bastion of autocracy thuggery and oppression in the middle east it is therefore time for all of us to stop mincing words and hiding behind opaque diplomatic ambiguities anyone who supports the so called two state solution and advocates the expulsion of jews from places such as hebron shiloh and beit el is a would be ethnic cleanser in the name of a dubious peace backers of such an idea are willing to countenance discrimination and the deportation of an entire ethnic or religious community just imagine the outrage that would ensue if a senior israeli official were to suggest that israeli arabs be physically removed from their homes and shipped off to a nascent palestinian state and yet for some reason the international community and many of our fellow israelis have no qualms about embracing this double standard despite the clear hypocrisy upon which it is based all those who promote the idea of creating a palestinian entity need to look themselves in the mirror and ask if they truly believe that the ends justify the means does the establishment of palestinian sovereignty warrant the violation of the human and civil rights of hundreds of thousands of jews in judea and samaria does the desire of palestinians to run their own affairs really outweigh the importance of true coexistence between arab and jew the answer i dare say is no what kerry and other supporters of a palestinian state fail to grasp is that something so basic that it should not even need to be said simply put a peace based on immorality and injustice is one that cannot will not and should not stand and nothing would be more immoral or unjust than the creation of apartheid palestine and the exile of its jews from their homes fundamentally freund
