israel releases some palestinian funds but sticking points remain rewarding what it called partial cooperation from the palestinian authority israel said today that it would pay part of the money owed to palestinians that was frozen as punishment after the suicide bombing last month in a jerusalem market but prime minister benjamin netanyahu s office said israel would not call a complete halt to the financial blockade until yasir arafat the palestinian leader heeded israeli demands for a widespread crackdown on islamic militants the main thing has not been done unconditional systematic and incessant palestinian authority action against terror groups said israel s cabinet secretary danny naveh the decision to hand over 12 million of the 40 million that israel owes to the palestinian authority was announced this morning after a sunday night meeting of intelligence officials that included senior c i a officers during the meeting palestinian intelligence officials shared with their israeli counterparts samples of explosives seized last month in a raid on a suspected bomb making factory near bethlehem the israeli authorities have been eager to determine whether there were similarities between the makeup of those explosives and the ones used in the bombs that killed 16 people on july 30 but accounts from both sides indicated that they were continuing to bicker over israeli calls for the arrest of more than 200 suspected islamic militants an aide to mr arafat nabil abu rdainah called mr netanyahu s decision to release the money which is to be transferred on tuesday a positive first step but palestinian officials have continued vehement objections to israel s demand for further palestinian action as the price for unfreezing any more of the taxes and customs fees still being withheld it s not his money saeb erekat a top palestinian negotiator said of mr netanyahu it s our money the israeli action went only partway toward addressing a similar complaint from the united states which has criticized the withholding of the payments on which the palestinian authority relies heavily as counterproductive senior israeli officials conceded tonight that palestinian security officials were now cooperating fully in the investigation into who might have carried out the jerusalem market bombing but an aide to mr netanyahu david bar illan said it was not enough for the palestinian authorities to cooperate in that investigation alone calling the bombing a symptom of the broader problem from the palestinian side there was no indication that security forces were preparing to round up the suspected islamic militants a demand that mr arafat has rejected as an israeli dictate instead senior officials of the palestinian authority said that they were preparing a plan to boycott all but essential israeli goods and that they were drawing up lists including coca cola israeli made cigarettes televisions and other items that they said they intended to bar from being imported into palestinian governed territory we have economic weapons that we can use too a senior palestinian official said tonight
