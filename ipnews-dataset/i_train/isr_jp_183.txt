the us israeli bond endures over the past few months the relationship between the us and israel has been put under a media microscope every symbolic gesture every diplomatic maneuver and every political utterance has been magnified beyond its importance this has left some americans and israelis believing and those who wish us ill hoping that the relationship between our countries has become irrevocably strained in fact the relationship between our two countries transcends our national leaders partisan politics and election campaigns it is not defined by congress and the knesset any more than it is defined by the president and prime minister political leaders come and go diplomatic dances change rhythm in concert with world events toes inevitably get stepped on giving commentators plenty of fodder yet through it all the us israeli bond grows stronger because it is based not on our inherently different politics but on our intrinsically common democratic values free elections free markets and free speech those values remain under attack in much of the world and in the middle east they are threatened as never before the rise of the latest terrorist group pledging death to america and israel the stateless islamic state along with irans nuclear ambitions civil war in syria and unrest throughout the region present our nations leaders with difficult and complicated challenges it is inevitable that differences of opinion will emerge over how to address them but the familial tensions that make for good copy should not obscure the unity of purpose that makes our alliance so strong to see the true nature of the us israeli relationship you have to look beyond the headlines both of us have had the opportunity to see and support the increasing business cultural and philanthropic networks that exist between our countries including through an organization called the genesis prize foundation the genesis prize aims to strengthen ties between israel and the jewish people in america and worldwide through an award that honors individuals who have attained excellence and international renown in their chosen professional fields and who have inspired others
