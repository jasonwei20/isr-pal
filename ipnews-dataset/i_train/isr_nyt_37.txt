israel says all archaeologists can dig for ancient artifacts israeli officials opened the search for new dead sea scrolls to archeologists from around the world today and invited palestinians to join the hunt the invitation was an attempt to blunt criticism by palestinians that israel was plundering artifacts shortly before it gave up the land as part of the israeli accord with the palestine liberation organization a statement from the antiquities authority promised that any discoveries would be subject to a settlement reached in palestinian israeli talks the desert is very big and we welcome any archeologist from around the world too said the antiquities authority spokeswoman efrat orbach but nazmi joubi an archeologist and adviser to the palestinian negotiating team rejected the israeli offer saying the israelis are like those who confiscate a plot of land and then ask the owner to come and negotiate how to divide up that piece of land we cannot cooperate under a scientific umbrella and under these conditions they should not dig in the first place
