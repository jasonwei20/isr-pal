hot off the arab press israel wins and hamas loses makkah mecca july 24 to be clear i have been pro palestinian since birth and love palestine says writer zuhair al kutbi however it is now time to acknowledge hamass mistakes in jeopardizing a whole nation to achieve partisan gains although hamas felt victorious after the schlalit swap deal it needs to understand the power of the idf with primitive technology israel is capable of destroying hamas hamas gave israel the opportunity to destroy the infrastructure and achievements of the innocent palestinian people israel didnt spare a chance to kill children women and old people destroying whatever it could from homes and hospitals to police stations with a growing number of deaths every day hamas needs to avoid provoking israel i also understand the egyptian position of supporting hitting hamas for its participation in killing the egyptian people the result of this war is clear hamas has lost and israel has won a much needed intifada al ayyam ramallah july 28 gaza is not the only entity undergoing historical change the palestinian future as a whole will undergo a change if a third intifada breaks out says writer khaled al hroub the intifada will turn things upside down and return the situation to where it belongs a nation revolting against a militant colonial occupation such an uprising would confuse the current militant israeli strategy which benefits from the calm period provided by the ineffectual oslo agreement years of security coordination with israel might make such a revolution difficult in the west bank but it is not impossible the third intifada can exploit a rare opportunity of national unity strengthened by the important steadfastness of the palestinian resistance the other thing an intifada could do is return the palestinian cause to the regional and israeli agenda palestine wins and israel loses al quds al arabi london july 27 the arab regimes are clearly not intending to break the arab and israeli sieges on gaza says writer mutee safadi this is not only to punish hamas but because the freedom of gaza would lead to the establishment of a democratic independent palestinian state israelis dont want the palestinians to have a state of their own as a result of their public struggle the arab nations are another reason to be disappointed especially when palestinians have split leaving arabs confused as whom to support however the resistance has proven its validity the end of the israeli siege will come soon then it will be followed by breaking free from all tyrannies including the local ones the attack on gaza has united all palestinians and israels collective killing of innocents is the last resort for the jewish state it exposes the states weakness amid the growing powers of resistance boycott between commitment and reaction al arabi al jadeed doha july 25 iraqi chaos poses serious challenges an nahar beirut july 27 the islamic state of iraq and syria isis threats are leading iraq to a problematic geopolitical position in which it threatens signs of normalcy in the region says writer khalil hanawe the cluster of risks intensifies as the palestinian israeli conflict goes on and the contest between russia and ukraine deepens these developments have the potential to take the world and particularly the region into uncertainty the increased volatility unless the various geopolitical conflicts are settled soon could draw a dark regional picture of destruction and killing overall isiss presence in the region is largely linked to developments in syria and iraq as soon as these two wartorn countries regain their security and stability removing leaders like syrias bashar assad and iraqs nouri al maliki they will definitely head towards destroying isiss caliphate in addition freedom is a must for palestinians to stop the damaging escalation people and governments need to act soon before things spin out of control arab media what citizens of other countries are reading about the middle east
