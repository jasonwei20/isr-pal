israel slams switzerland for convening geneva convention french senate narrowly recognizes palestine denmark likely to be first eu country to buck trend israel blasted switzerland on thursday for calling a special meeting of the high contracting parties of the fourth geneva convention next week which is expected to severely censure israel for its actions in the west bank and gaza switzerland the depository of the fourth geneva convention summoned the meeting following a request put forward by the palestinian authority after it joined the convention in april following the breakdown of the us backed israeli palestinian negotiations the meeting is scheduled for december 17 the fourth geneva convention on the rules of war was adopted in 1949 in a response to nazi atrocities it governs actions during war and the treatment of civilians in occupied territories in addition it also outlaws the resettlement by an occupying power of its own civilians on territory under its military control foreign ministry spokesman emmanuel nachshon said that switzerland as the depository is obligated to act in a neutral and apolitical manner switzerlands decision to convene the convention raises great doubts about its obligation to these principles while it is giving its hand to the politicization of the geneva convention and the laws of war in general he said nachshon said convening the meeting is a political step whose sole goal is to use the fourth geneva convention as a platform to blast israel not only will israel not participate he said but it is rethinking its position on other swiss initiatives regarding international humanitarian law israel he said is calling on all countries for whom the fourth geneva convention is important to boycott the meeting the decision to convene the meeting was only one piece of bad news jerusalem received thursday the other being the decision by the french senate to follow the lead of the french parliaments lower house and recommend the government recognize palestine the resolution passed by the slim margin of 153 146 what set this vote off from other measures that have already passed through the parliaments in spain britain and ireland however is that the french resolution was proposed by the governing party and not by opposition parties using the measure as a club against the governing party on the other hand the first country that may not pass such a resolution is denmark which held a debate on the motion on thursday danish ambassador jesper vahr predicted during a panel discussion at the annual jerusalem post diplomatic conference that the vast majority of the danish parliament will reject the proposal to recognize the state of palestine he explained that this would not be because denmark does not believe in a two state solution but rather that to do so at this time would not be fruitful he also indicated that he thinks recognition should be done by the eu in unison rather than by each country unilaterally aviv shir on the foreign ministrys deputy director general for western europe said a danish refusal to pass such a resolution would be significant shir on added without referencing the danish parliament that he finds it odd that even as parliaments in europe are taking the liberty to debate the recognition of a palestinian state at the same time europe criticizes the israeli parliament debating a jewish state this is a bit strange and this is what we are trying to explain to our friends in europe
