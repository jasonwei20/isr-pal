the israeli american connector as national chairman of the israeli american council an umbrella group of americans of israeli descent living in the us the los angeles based adam milstein sees himself as the connector between israel and the us and at the forefront of fighting the anti israel bds movement we are the nexus between the israeli and american people the affable milstein says in an interview with jerusalem post editors during a recent visit to jerusalem we feel that the israeli american community is equipped and has the information necessary to lead the fight against bds under milsteins leadership the iac has emerged as a powerhouse last june he helped to organize a summit that brought together philanthropists such as sheldon adelson a republican and haim saban a democrat as well as some 60 american jewish organizations at the campus maccabees summit in las vegas to harness the full might of the pro israel community to defeat the hate groups now spreading anti semitism and lies about the jewish state on americas college campuses we know that bds is not just an anti semitic movement but a movement to eradicate the state of israel milstein says sternly i dont think the people of israel understand that we live in the us and we see what the leaders of this movement are saying theyre saying that israel should not exist and that from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea there should be a free palestine milstein strongly believes that the iac should be leading the battle against the delegitimization of israel we got a big problem in explaining ourselves when people are not interested in listening we need to fight back what israeli americans bring to the table is that we are willing to be offensive we should be at the forefront of the fight against bds in the united states he says milstein believes there are some one million israeli americans in the us noting that the iac reaches about half of them via its 10 nationwide offices we are the fastest growing jewish organization in the united states he says our kenes conference started a year and a half ago with 650 people last year doubled to 1 300 and this year we are expecting 2 500 people aipac is an important partner of the iac and recognizes that we are the fastest growing jewish organization in the us the iac considers itself non partisan when it comes to both israel and the us milstein says we dont have any political affiliation not in israel and not in the united states we believe that the people of israel spoke freely and democratically and we support the people of israel and the government of israel whoever that is we dont get involved in politics the same thing in the united states we dont take sides so when we have our conferences in dc we invite people from across the political rainbow the haifa born milstein 64 moved with his wife gila from israel to los angeles in 1981 initially to get his masters degree in business administration at the university of south california but they kept postponing their return he became a successful real estate investor and so they stayed fifteen years ago they established the philanthropic adam and gila milstein family foundation and today they have three daughters the youngest of whom was born in the us and three grandchildren we set out to do whatever we can to strengthen the state of israel the jewish people and obviously the strong connection between them which makes each one of them stronger he says everything that we do in the foundation in our personal lives and in the iac is really to accomplish those two goals one such project is sifriyat pijama bamerica or the hebrew pj library as it is affectionately called which delivers free books in hebrew every month to the children of israeli families living in the us we developed the concept to reach the israeli community in los angeles to become more connected to israel to come to the rallies to help israel in the case of emergency but over time it developed into something much much bigger than we envisioned milstein says our mission today is to reach israeli americans wherever they may be in the us and unite them into one organization that is very big very influential and very philanthropic we understand the challenges that the israeli people face and we live in america theres nobody better than us to make the connection between the two people in this respect we want to reach out to latinos and christians and evangelicals and african americans and connect with them on mutual interests in order to make a strong connection between the american people and the israeli people milstein says he is fortunate enough to devote about 80 percent of his time today to philanthropic projects gila and i wanted to be active philanthropists and not just write out checks he said its really everything from a to z you have an idea you want to build a plan you want to see it come to fruition you put money in it and you put time into it and you use all your resources to make ideas happen among other things they bring jewish and non jewish campus leaders to the annual aipac conference and send 40 non jewish students annually to israel on a program similar to birthright milstein makes a point of maintaining contact with the students after the programs and he believes some of them will be the leaders of the future he says he is motivated by the belief conveyed to him by his modern orthodox business partner that whatever we give god gives us back ten times more and his desire to keep his own daughters and their families connected to judaism and israel i have created my own kind of philanthropy over the years and i have gotten the reputation that i am some kind of jewish connector because im funding some 100 organizations and i know who operates in every field he says with a knowing smile if there is a mission i know who can help me and who is irrelevant milstein sits on the board of several organizations including what he calls one of the best israel advocacy groups standwithus and is always on the lookout for new projects people with ideas come to me and if i like the ideas i fund them often with huge success he says taking out his cellular phone for example there is this new phone application called talkisrael you download it it asks you what subject you are interested in and it sends you articles and videos about the things that you like which you can share on your social media channel by a push of a button adam milstein tells the post why the iac is spearheading the fight against bds annual conference
