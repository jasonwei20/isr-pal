the populist winds are blowing one day before the sochi winter olympics drew to a close in russia ukrainian president viktor yanukovych was ousted as a result of severe clashes in kiev and opposition leader yulia tymoshenko was released from imprisonment the consequent thaw is a reminder of the present muddy political terrain in europe where surging populist parties are on the march from finland to greece at the same time as demands for boycotts against israel gain momentum jacques schuster in the german newspaper die welt questioned last week a few of the outcries in the current unified european protest against israel are we seeing the same primal anger toward the jews he asked and cited israeli author amos oz in the past you could read jews go to palestine on every other house wall

continued palestinian recognition of israel as jewish is critical prime minister binyamin netanyahu hopes other european countries will follow merkels guiding lights he said there can be criticism of israel that is legitimate adding but its hard not to notice the fact that those who call for boycotts of israel are not calling for the boycott of any other country more and more european companies
