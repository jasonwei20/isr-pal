calling palestine a state icc probes idf international criminal court prosecutor fatou bensouda late friday initiated a preliminary probe into whether the idf committed war crimes during the recent gaza war and more seriously declared definitively that palestine is a state for the purpose of such an investigation the declaration of palestine as a state is the most serious escalation toward possible war crimes trials of idf personnel and israeli leaders the country has yet faced bensoudas decision does not mean actual war crimes trials are imminent israel has a range of jurisdictional objections it can make at this preliminary probe phase a stage where bensouda gathers information to decide whether to fully investigate and potentially file indictments one is that its own war crimes investigations make icc investigations superfluous a defense that could be extremely viable since icc rules do not permit it to investigate war crimes in countries that reasonably self investigate another is that the pa signed away any right to seek icc intervention under the oslo accords yet another is that israel is not a member of the icc and could just decide not to show up and there are many others still the announcement raises the stakes and likely ushers in a hard hitting era in which israel the pa and their supporters will swamp the icc with legal memoranda about why it should or should not investigate further an entirely separate debate over icc investigations may go forward regarding israeli settlements which former icc prosecutor luis moreno ocampo said potentially could be viewed as war crimes
