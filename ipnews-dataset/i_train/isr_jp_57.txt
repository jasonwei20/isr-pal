still unhidden connections israel iran and palestine the terrible ifs accumulate winston churchill the world crisis although a seemingly separate issue the middle east peace process cannot be properly assessed without considering the simultaneous impact of a nuclear iran a nuclear iran however unwitting would enlarge the regional stability costs of a palestinian state any palestinian state more precisely should iranian nuclearization and palestine emerge at more or less the same time the cumulatively corrosive impact would be substantially greater than the mere sum of these parts both israel and the us must remain keenly aware of what the generals would call force multipliers among assorted other regional consequences virulent synergies between iranian nuclearization and palestinian statehood could create an existential threat to the jewish state oddly these potentially lethal and multiplying interactive effects are unhidden yet largely unrecognized what exactly might these destabilizing effects be to respond jerusalem and washington must first consider pertinent geo strategic context in the steadily unraveling middle east certain core adversarial patterns remain unchanged most conspicuously israel endures under still coordinated international pressures to 1 renounce its undeclared nuclear forces and 2 reciprocally to join in a disingenuously proffered nuclear weapon free zone if iran and its allies should come to believe that israel had been sufficiently weakened by their nonproliferation demands a previously calculated annihilation strategy against israel could proceed seamlessly perhaps this military strategy could advance from terror to mega terror and in successively added increments from mega terror to war to mega war with us president barack obamas explicit and continuing support nuclear weapons are now widely regarded as destabilizing or even as inherently evil in the specific case of israel however the recognizable possession of such weapons could actually sometime become all that protects civilian populations from catastrophic aggression doubtlessly maintaining successful nuclear deterrence whether still ambiguous or newly disclosed will ultimately prove indispensable to israels survival in its advisory opinion of july 8 1996 the international court of justice at the hague ruled the court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self defense where the very survival of a state would be at stake continued the icj even the actual use of nuclear weapons could at times be permissible there is more israel is not iran israel makes no threats of aggressive war or genocide none for the moment at least it does not even publicly acknowledge its advanced nuclear capabilities geo strategic truth may be counterintuitive not all nuclear weapon states are created equal not all states with nuclear capability are automatically a menace some may even offer a distinct benefit to world peace on its face the plainly small size of israel precludes national tolerance of any nuclear attack this point has even been made openly by a senior iranian official who stated ominously israel is a one bomb state israel is less than half the size of americas lake michigan to be sure israels nuclear weapons are not the problem in the middle east the only persistent source of war and terrorism remains a far reaching and still unreconstructed arab islamist commitment to excise the jewish cancer what about iran with a more openly declared nuclear weapons posture israel could more reliably deter a rational iranian enemys unconventional attacks and also most of its large conventional aggressions with such a suitably updated posture israel if necessary could launch appropriately non nuclear preemptive strikes against iranian hard targets and against associated counterforce capabilities significantly these assets could otherwise threaten israels physical survival with impunity in the absence of acknowledging its possession of certain survivable and penetration capable nuclear weapons therefore israeli acts of anticipatory self defense would most likely represent the onset of much wider war the reason is simple there would then remain no aptly convincing threat of israeli counter retaliation the decision to bring its bomb out of the basement would not be an easy one for israel nonetheless the realities of facing not only a nuclear capable iran but also other potential nuclear aspirants in the region in compelling synergies with anti israel terrorists obligate a serious reconsideration of deliberate ambiguity as corollary jerusalem would need to clarify that its multiple level active defenses will always operate in tandem with its decisive nuclear retaliations what about palestine the other half of a prospectively corrosive synergy soon it will soon become apparent that islamic state is and other related jihadist fighters plan to move against certain state and sub state enemies already in fact is is challenging hamas control of gaza and is preparing to march westward across the vulnerable country of jordan in time of course is forces are likely to find themselves at the gates of the west bank judea samaria the territories still widely presumed to become palestine if when is arrives a palestinian state has not yet been created these forces will effectively occupy the strategic territories for themselves if a palestinian state has already been formalized they would then make quick work of the new states predictably ragtag army and more or less easily become the de facto government of palestine what should all of this mean for israel the disturbingly plausible narrative ought to suggest the unreasonableness of clinging to any residual notions of a discredited two state solution for the palestinians and their supporters this same scenario should confirm that the single greatest hindrance to a palestinian state any palestinian state will not be israel but rather another even more barbarous band of sunni arab terrorists the writer phd princeton 1971 is the
