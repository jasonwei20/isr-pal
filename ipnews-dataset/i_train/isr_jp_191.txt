losing the rational israeli it was less than a half hour drive from my home in maaleh adumim but it was like entering another country which is essence jericho is along with a contingent of jerusalem post editors and reporters i was in the palestinian city to meet with pa strongman jibril rajoub who has been part of the israeli palestinian landscape since the beginning of the oslo accords over two decades ago despite his past terrorist activities and his reputation as somewhat of a burly enforcer rajoub has emerged over the years as someone willing and eager to engage israelis and as a moderate voice on the palestinian side gracious hospitable and displaying fluency in english and hebrew rajoub eloquently explained the palestinian view of the current stalemate between the governments of benjamin netanyahu and mahmoud abbas and the prospects of improvements in the trump era amid the expected palestinians as occupied victims rhetoric rajoub provided some fresh perspectives in pointing out how he was encouraged by the groundswell of rational israelis and rational palestinians who realize the imperative of forging a two state solution outside of the tent he implicated the baruch marzels and the netanyahus on our side and supposedly palestinians who attack innocent israelis on their side even though he never actually said who the irrational palestinians are he also spoke of both sides having to make painful concessions before a lasting solution could be achieved among the post staff there was admittedly an air of deference to him as a senior pa official and as someone who was seen as a potential successor to abbas after his nearly one hour monologue rajoub opened up the floor for questions when my turn came i asked him to expand on his painful concessions statement identifying myself as a resident of nearby maaleh adumim i pointed out that the common wisdom through the years of negotiations and setbacks is that all sides israelis palestinians americans realized that the large settlement blocs like adumim gush etzion and ariel would remain part of israel in a two state solution i asked him if the painful concessions he mentioned included recognizing that likelihood as part of a land adjustment of the pre 1967 war lines rajoub answered by raising his voice and saying absolutely not all settlements were a malignant cancer whose fault is it that they exist he demanded to know adding that it was israels problem to solve not his at the risk of increasing his wrath i interrupted rajoub during his tirade if thats your position then youre losing the rational israeli i retorted explaining that if he and the palestinian leadership couldnt differentiate between small isolated settlements in the heart of the west bank and the big blocs then the chance of reaching any kind of accord is simply zero that just upset him even more leading to another soliloquy about whether his relatives would be allowed to go back to acre and haifa i was tempted to paraphrase from woody allens annie hall and say i have to go now jibril because im due back on the planet earth instead i simply said youre talking about aspirations im talking about reality so while youre very clear on what the painful concessions are on the israeli side remind me exactly what are the painful palestinian concessions youre referring to i asked rajoub answered that they included establishing a palestinian state on only 22 of historic palestine giving up any future claims on land and normalizing ties with israel the exchange soon reached to its conclusion and the rest of the q a session reverted to less contentious repartee at the end rajoub shook everyones hand including the settlers and offered a passover greeting in hebrew the happy ending didnt leave me feeling encouraged though its admittedly unreasonable to expect rajoub or any palestinian leader to acknowledge that the pa is willing to leave the settlement blocs in place its part of their negotiating strategy but if thats the case why not say in public that issues like that will be discussed around the table with the israelis if it is indeed common knowledge among those in the know that the settlement blocs are a given in a final status agreement between israel and the palestinians then rajoub must have not received the memo given the opportunity to break away from the palestinian intransigence of the past and acknowledge the inevitability of facts on the ground just as the israeli public has acknowledged the inevitability of a palestinian state rajoub retreated to the tired and standard slogans of the past whats a rational israeli to think
