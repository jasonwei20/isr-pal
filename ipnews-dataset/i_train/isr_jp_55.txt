lionized and glorified by students for justice in palestine sjp the campus arm of the global boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign many on university campuses misunderstand sjp the group describes itself as a grassroots student organization that supports palestinian freedom and equality in advocating for palestinian statehood this is a false and misleading characterization the organizations chapters have defied official university warnings and sanctions and have transformed leading campuses in the united states and europe into fortresses of fear intimidation and retribution exposing and thwarting students for justice in palestine is essential to restoring universities as a safe environment for the peaceful and respectful exchange of ideas sjps proprietary notion of

as hamas the pflp and islamic jihad these groups demonize israel and use antisemitic imagery and rhetoric as ideological and psychological pretexts for launching terrorist attacks against the jewish state while sjp is not formally a terrorist organization its expressions of support ideological sympathies and financial and other affiliations with radical extremist and terrorist groups is worrying

integrity and realize their promise to be a safe environment for the peaceful and respectful exchange of ideas sjp can no longer be countenanced university regulations and the us constitution were established to protect free speech it is precisely that freedom that students for justice in palestine has hijacked and holds hostage in service of imposing a hate filled antisemitic and often violent
