 Israeli authorities have detained two mothers of Palestinian prisoners as they were visiting them in the Rimon prison facility. These photos speak a thousand words.  Mohamed Al-Badan was shot, wounded and arrested in 2008 from inside the Gilo settlement, an illegal Jewish settlement built on annexed land of the Beit Jala town in east Jerusalem. He underwent surgery that had seen his intestines partially removed. Their cousin Zayd al-Badan, at 24, was detained from home in November 2017, alongside 16 others from around the West Bank on the day. Family visits, once allowed, take place every two weeks for 45 minutes and are restricted to first-degree relative. All visitors, except Jerusalem ID holders, must apply for entry permits to Israel through International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Israel’s prison authorities and military forces recruit women soldiers to detain, and accompany women prisoners during transfers; however, they are no less violent than male soldiers. “Women soldiers deploy violent methods of control against Palestinian men and women in an effort to seek respect and recognition from male soldiers and their superiors.” Palestinian Churches in Jerusalem Cry Foul over Israeli Tax Law Open Letter: A Call for the NDP to Withdraw from the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group
