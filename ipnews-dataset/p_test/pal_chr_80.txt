 Three Palestinians were killed and seven others wounded on Friday in clashes and violence with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, Palestinian medics and witnesses said. Medics said that Israeli soldiers shot dead a 16-year-old Palestinian teen and seriously wounded another near the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Jalazoon north of the West Bank city of Ramallah.  Witnesses said that Palestinian teens threw stones at Israeli soldiers outside the refugee camp who dispersed the teens with gunfire. One teen was killed and another was seriously injured.  Earlier in the day, another Palestinian young man was killed when Israeli soldiers dispersed an anti-separation wall demonstration in a village near the city of Ramallah, witnesses said, adding that seven more people were injured.  Every Friday, Palestinian and foreign activists demonstrate near the separation wall in the area, waving flags and chanting slogans against the wall and Israel.  On Friday morning, a third Palestinian was also killed in an Israeli settlement near the southern West Bank city of Hebron. Israel said he stabbed a settler by a knife and soldiers shot him dead.  Violence in the West Bank mounted on Friday, as U.S. special envoy George Mitchell held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and insisted that the best way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is to implement the two-state solution.
