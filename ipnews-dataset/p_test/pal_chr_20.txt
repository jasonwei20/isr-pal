 An Israeli Knesset panel has recommended revoking the privileges of lawmaker Haneen Zuabi after she took part in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla aid convoy.  The decision was passed in the Knesset’s House Committee by a majority of seven to one on Monday, Israeli media reported.  The move is conditional on the approval of the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) plenum.  If approved, the Palestinian member of the Knesset will lose her right to leave Israel as well as her diplomatic passport.  Zuabi said that members of her Balad party were victims of a witch-hunt after the Flotilla was attacked by Israeli commandos.  Last Monday, the Israeli Navy attacked the convoy carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian supplies for the besieged people of Gaza, who have been under blockade for three years.  The 41-year-old Zuabi, who has received death threats for participating in the relief effort, condemned the deadly Israeli attack which killed and wounded many international peace activists. Zuabi’s party has also denounced the Knesset decision, describing it as racist and anti-democratic.  Swedish FM: Siege of Gaza is Unacceptable Israeli MP Who Joined Flotilla Faces Witchhunt
