mideast accord jericho israelis are transfixed palestinians run from the rapturous to the furious we are feeling freedom many people in the middle east reacted to the signing of the israeli palestinian accord with rejoicing but strong curents of confusion anger and dismay ran through israel the occupied territories and neighboring arab countries here is a sampling of the reaction he gave his name as fatah one of hundreds of young men who packed the center of this city today carrying waving and wrapping themselves in palestinian flags in a daylong eruption of joy we are feeling freedom he said when i used to raise the flag israeli soldiers would call me a rebel today there is palestine and peace between us and israel throughout the west bank and the gaza strip today palestinians took to the streets in rapturous and noisy celebrations of the palestine liberation organization accord with israel and what they said was the cornerstone of their future state all day and into the night they sang danced and marched savoring a new reality few had dared to imagine just a few weeks ago in gaza they handed flowers to israeli soldiers in east jerusalem they shouted shalom hebrew for peace to israeli well wishers and not the arabic salaam sleepy jericho the seat of the future palestinian self governing authority is a city transformed it has 15 000 residents and at times it looked as though every one of them was in the streets banners and loudspeakers thousands of townspeople including flag waving young men some in fatigues milled about the central square in a raucous nationalist carnival buildings were covered with huge palestinian banners and pictures of yasir arafat loudspeakers boomed out praises of the p l o and its leader convoys of honking cars wound through the streets as young men sat on roofs waving flags men danced in a circle as an announcer told them that their leader was watching abu ammar is in the white house the announcer shouted using mr arafat s nom de guerre and he is seeing you live the accord is already changing the face of the occupied territories and east jerusalem where palestinian flags which had technically been banned fly with impunity on the highway from jerusalem motorists flew palestinian flags from their cars draped them on dashboards and displayed pictures of mr arafat although the flags are officially outlawed israeli soldiers and police officers did nothing to remove them and looked on quietly graffiti and banners told their own stories we want peace said a slogan in hebrew letters across the street from an israeli police headquarters the words were flanked by drawings of a rifle and a dove one banner praised mr arafat s fatah group in the p l o saying fatah has sown the armed struggle and reaped political achievements another banner referred to the planned self rule in jericho and the gaza strip promising gaza and jericho are the path to the palestinian state i m indescribably happy a man said as he watched the celebrations another man said no one else can sense what we feel in east jerusalem which palestinians see as their future capital the palestinian flag of red green white and black was raised in a ceremony at the orient house the sweeping headquarters of the palestinian delegation to the peace talks that has taken on the trappings of a government building a scout band played a message from mr arafat was read aloud and several hundred cheered and sang the palestinian anthem my land o land of my forefathers my people o people of eternity goes the refrain later thousands streamed to a nearby soccer field to watch additional marching bands flag bearers and teams of horsemen galloping with the palestinian colors fluttering in the wind cars plastered with posters clogged the streets some carrying men in camouflage uniforms reminiscent of p l o fighters in lebanon a popular car sticker had mr arafat s face and the words yes to the peacemaker black banners flew early in the day in the gaza strip where the militant islamic group hamas called a general strike to protest the accord shops were shuttered verses of the koran were read over mosque loudspeakers young men burned tires and stoned passing cars but several hours later the celebrations began according to an agreement worked out in advance between local leaders of hamas and fatah sooner than we expected palestinian political leaders including members of the delegation to the peace talks joined israeli peace advocates and leftist politicians to watch the signing ceremony on television at the graceful american colony hotel in east jerusalem deafening applause greeted the handshake between prime minister yitzhak rabin and mr arafat followed by warm embraces between palestinians and israelis along with the euphoria however there was the concern by many palestinians who worry that the beginning of self rule in gaza and jericho might prove to be the last stop for their hopes of an independent state but zahira kamal who was with the palestinian delegation at the opening peace conference in madrid two years ago said palestinians and israelis would have to do serious work to carry out the accords signed in washington the agreement was signed there she said how it will work is our responsibility graphic photo gaza strip palestinians in the shati refugee camp were jubilant too as they watched the signing reuters
