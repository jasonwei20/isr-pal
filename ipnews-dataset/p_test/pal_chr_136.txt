 Several Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces and in clashes with Israeli settlers who had attacked their village in the northern West Bank.  A mob of about 100 armed Israeli settlers on Tuesday attacked the village of Asira al-Qibiliya, south of Nablus, AFP reported.  Palestinians responded to the assailants, reportedly from the nearby settlement of Yitzhar, by throwing stones.  Israeli forces soon intervened and fired rubber bullets and tear gas to end the clashes.  Several Palestinian villagers were injured in the clashes while a journalist from the Palestinian news agency WAFA who was beaten by settlers.  A 14-year-old Palestinian boy was taken to hospital after being hit by a tear-gas canister. A group of activists confirmed the report as part of their newly launched campaign of monitoring settler attacks, called "Eyes of Resistance.”  The attack was the latest instance of Israeli settlers’ violence against Palestinians, especially the residents of Asira al-Qibiliya, who have been repeatedly assaulted by Israelis in the past years.  In recent weeks, at least three mosques, a university building, several cars and farmlands have been vandalized in a series of attacks by Israeli settlers.  Tel Aviv has criticized the attacks, but the Palestinians accuse the Israeli military and the police personnel of deliberately failing to track down and to prosecute those behind the attacks.  The Palestinian Authority on Tuesday issued a statement following the attack, and condemned "a menacing trend of settler violence which the Israeli authorities are doing nothing to prevent.”  "It is not credible that the Israeli army — one of the most formidable military organizations in the world — cannot apply the rule of law to its own citizens,” it argued.
