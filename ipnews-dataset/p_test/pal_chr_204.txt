 We in Canada are well schooled in this logic. From our liberal intellectual community, Irving Abella, for example, has long argued that ‘Israel’s democracy is at war with Arab demography’.[4] Abella has not yet done the ethnic head-counting to determine exactly how many Palestinians is too many. But he and others have pointed us in the right direction. What is Palestinian life, in this logic, if not the legitimate object of a decades-long war? And when the facts of this war are considered, who can be considered innocent? Visiting Ottawa a few weeks before Israel’s full re-invasion of the West Bank in 2002 (Operation Defensive Shield), then Israeli president Moshe Katzav stood next to deputy prime minister John Manley as he delivered the message to Canadians. ‘Each Palestinian baby, when he was born, he took with the milk of his mother incitement against the Jews.’[5] The basic sustenance of Palestinians and the antisemitic threat; decade after decade, respectable Canadians have been made to understand. Jean Chrétien took the occasion of Katsav’s visit to declare that ‘the friendship between Canada and Israel is a horizon which expands whenever we approach it.’[6] Across the West, in fact, support for Israel was historically stronger on the left than the right of the governing political spectrum. Democrats in the US, the Labour Party in Britain, and the Socialist Party in France were for decades all more strongly associated with Israel than were their conservative counterparts. Likewise in Canada. It is generally agreed that there was more disagreement on Middle East policy within than between the main Canadian political parties. But all in all, as Irving Abella notes in the same 1989 interview that I cite above, ‘the New Democratic Party has been the most supportive of the Israeli cause, largely because of its close relationship to Israel’s Labour party, and to the Histadrut, the Israeli trade union movement’.[9] For a time in the late 1980s, the Liberals seemed the party most contemptuous of Palestinian rights. Since the 2000s, this position has definitively fallen to the Tories. Still, the NDP’s pro-Israel history is not so distant a historical artifact. The predominance of the NDP’s pro-Israel faction lasted well into the 1980s. Under Reagan and Likud, it became all too obvious that to consistently support Israel was to be on the wrong side of most major world conflicts of the day. Israel was globally allied with forces of the far right. Pressure built up in 1982, when Israeli forces under Ariel Sharon’s command devastated Lebanon, killing thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese. At the end of the year, Sharon visited Honduras, highlighting Israeli support for the US-backed contra war against Nicaragua. Sharon’s host, General Gustavo Álvarez Martínez, had proclaimed his admiration for two of history’s great military men: Irwin Rommel and Ariel Sharon.[10] The 1982 massacres of Palestinians and Lebanese could not be ignored. Israel’s military support of the Latin American far right, meanwhile, like its alliance with apartheid South Africa, could not be brushed aside with anti-Arab racism or the standard lies surrounding the Palestine question. Reviewing its policy in 1983, the NDP issued some words of criticism. It condemned ‘the collaboration of Israel with one of the world’s most racist regimes’ (South Africa) and raised questions about ‘recent reports of Israeli military advisers in Honduras, and the visit of Defence Minister Sharon there.’[11] Nonetheless, despite gradual movement on the Palestine question, the party’s fundamental support for Israel remained unshaken. NDP stalwarts like Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Dennis McDermott remained regressive advocates for Israel through to the end of the Cold War and beyond. By the time open Israeli warfare against the Palestinians intensified anew in the 2000s, the NDP tended to be more critical of Israel than the other federalist parties. Israeli propaganda had become harder for social democrats to swallow, as Israel’s Labour Party hypocrisy was pushed to the margins by the more forthright colonialism of the Israeli right. One should not write out of history the efforts of those in the NDP who distinguished themselves, by Canadian standards, in their criticism of Israel’s perpetual war on the Palestinians. There were years in which they pushed the NDP towards some decent human rights advocacy. But their position in the party should not be exaggerated, either in its prominence or its durability. Of the main federalist parties, the NDP can credibly cast itself as the lesser evil. As the least bad of the  electoral options, it has also drawn into its ranks principled people looking to bring some progressive politics into the narrow spectacle of Canadian electoral politics. There are surely those on the periphery of the party looking to draw things in as decent a direction as the structures allow. The Mulcair leadership, however, is doing its very best to emphasize that it is not out to transform Canadian politics. Rather, it is vying for the managerial task of presiding over a slightly tweaked version of the economic and foreign policy status quo. Set aside the fact that in this calculus, Palestinians rank nowhere near that classic US standard, ‘three-fifths of a human being’. Given the balance between Israeli and Palestinian civilian deaths tolls, a focus on Palestinian as against Israeli terrorism only adds up if a Palestinian life is worth less than one-hundredth of an Israeli. Set aside the NDP’s failure to seriously challenge the Harper Tories for their brazen celebration of Israeli efforts to destroy Palestinian society. In the final count, Mulcair’s fidelity to a complicit federal consensus should be condemned. But it is not terribly surprising. The NDP is not riding the crest of a wave of social movements. The difficulty for movements to hold elected social-democratic leaders accountable in the best of circumstances is painfully familiar. In a system as rotten as Canada’s, and as tightly structured around established social hierarchies, even a leader campaigning to the left could hardly be expected to stay there once elected in the absence of massive social pressure from below. Mulcair is barely going through the motions. He is presenting himself as a prospective manager of the status quo, not its adversary. A significant change in Canadian policy on Palestine will never come without more of a fight. It will take a change in the balance of forces, not a change in management. To be fair, the relationship between some genuine dissidents and left elements within the NDP is not replicated in the other main federal parties. Moreover, of those vying to tweak Canada’s economic and foreign policy status quo, the NDP is less proactively destructive than the Tories, and arguably more susceptible to popular pressure than the Liberals, should movements arise that can approach its leadership with the necessary fighting spirit. Nonetheless the miserable fact, as Podur writes, is that ‘if voters want to cast their ballot this October for a major Canadian party that believes that Palestinians are human beings too, they can’t.’ In twenty-first century Canada, it is easy for many to ask whether the position that Palestinians are human beings is one of those many notions that are just too radical for Canadian respectability. Differences of degree can matter, and attention to contradictions and openings can help guide strategic action. At the same time, weighing these differences without losing one’s humanity requires some balance. The problem is suggested by Sadri Khiari’s commentary on the all-too-reasonable expectations of white liberalism in France. Khiari writes: ‘It reminds me, from the time of slavery, of those white abolitionists who considered that the balance of forces – between whites – didn’t yet allow for more demands than the right for slaves to wear shoes or a shirt. In 1799, in England, the left of the epoch won a great victory: from then on, according to the terms of the new law, in the hold of the ships that transported them to America, the African deportees had to have an average space of 0.7 square metres and no longer 0.46 square metres. It was certain that this was progress since the right, if it knew about the process, would for its part surely have proposed that they be vacuum-packed . . .’.[12] How to most strategically relate to the contradictory pulls on the NDP is an open challenge. But the outrageous record of this Tory government is symptomatic of Canadian political realities that extend well beyond it. One way or the other, the long fight ahead should not be approached with any illusions. A Call to Palestinians Everywhere: Help Write Our History 5 Palestinians Jailed Without Trial Continue Hunger Strikes Good comments.  All Canadian political parties support Israel (Tories, Liberals, NDP, Greens) and Canadian foreign policy is well presented in the mainstream media.  It follows the usual format – for the NDP a touch of verbal sympathy for the Palestinians, a stronger note supporting Israel’s ‘right’ to defend itself.   For the Tories, it is outright Islamophobia, with Palestinians inclusively being terrorists.   The current election does not touch upon foreign policy, a topic that is generally ignored by the Canadian public at large until something dramatic happens such as the attacks on Gaza, or with that other new evil, the Russophobia from current affairs in Ukraine. Canadians need to connect the Palestinian struggle to the First Nations’ fight for de-colonisation and national rights. The Canadian and Israeli government label any grassroots opposition as a threat to security and as a form of terrorism. See the Canadian bill C-51. Will the NDP be any better than the Conservatives or Liberals? Marginally so, I expect.
