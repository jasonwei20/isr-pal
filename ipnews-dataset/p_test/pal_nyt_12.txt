burying jews grief is bitter anger intense their neighbors and fellow settlers laid mordechai and shalom lapid to rest in this ancient town today with prayers tears and virtual calls to rebellion against an israeli government that has agreed to palestinian self rule the funeral for the lapids a father and son shot to death monday night by palestinian gunmen outside the neighboring jewish settlement of qiryat arba touched off an emotional outpouring part mourning part protest and part distress signal for a government that acknowledges that every bullet chips away at public support for its agreement with the palestine liberation organization it was an unusual display involving thousands of people who joined a funeral procession across the center of the country and it graphically underscored the degree to which violence dominates the countdown toward the increasingly elusive deadline of dec 13 for the transfer of authority from israel to palestinians in the gaza strip and the west bank town of jericho officials still firm but in answer to questions whether the killings will unravel the agreement between israel and the p l o senior israeli officials say no still they clearly are rattled by the high death rate at least 50 arabs and jews have been killed since the agreement became known in early september and they say it cast a shadow over talks today in jerusalem between prime minister yitzhak rabin and secretary of state warren christopher we brought into consideration that we would have to go through a long corridor full of obstacles and costly in price undoubtedly foreign minister shimon peres said today to european journalists this doesn t change our minds and it won t change our minds some israeli political commentators however question whether the killings threaten to erode public confidence in the talks and in the government s ability to keep order with militant settlers turning to violence themselves and saying they will bring down the government some israelis have begun talking about anarchy though that would seem an overblown fear for now this murder threatens to be the point of breakdown said alex fishman a columnist for the newspaper maariv referring to the shootings of mordechai lapid 56 and shalom 19 his oldest son three of mr lapid s 13 other children were wounded it notched up the situation in the territories that was already boiling for some weeks and brought it up to the temperature of anarchy that might not be controlled by anybody not the government or the army or the palestinians themselves tense relationship deteriorates the relationship between the rabin government and the roughly 130 000 jewish settlers in the west bank and gaza has been antagonistic from the beginning now it is venomous it is especially so in hebron and qiryat arba there seems little doubt that if the talks with the p l o ever lead to a dismantling of the 140 jewish communities in the territories despite mr rabin s insistence they will not some residents will carry out their threats of armed insurrection hints of rebellion were dropped at the lapid funeral several thousand israelis filled the street outside the jerusalem great synagogue before the procession continued to hebron 20 miles south there were accounts of palestinians throwing stones at the marchers and of settlers and soldiers firing their guns three arabs were reported wounded one speaker at the funeral said let the word go out the jewish people will not tolerate this punish our neighbors for what they have done to us after settlers went on a shooting rampage in hebron last friday and killed a defenseless palestinian the next day at qiryat arba cabinet ministers denounced them as fanatics and warned of a crackdown agriculture minister yaacov tsur far from a dove said last week that settlers exploit every terrorist incident not to increase security but to destroy this government s peace policy mr peres echoed that thought in the interview today this is an attempt to politicize the violence and we don t take it don t buy it he said not surprisingly such remarks intensify the settlers anti government feelings but they also recognize that their ways are alien to large numbers of other israelis and so on monday they formed a new group hatikva to plead their case to the public by grim coincidence mr lapid s wife miriam was attending an organizing meeting of hatikva in tel aviv when drive by shooters fired at her husband and children graphic photo yesterday at the site of the monday night killing of mordechai and shalom lapid near the jewish settlement of qiryat arba in the occupied west bank a resident of the settlement offered prayers associated press map shows the location of hebron in the israeli occupied west bank
