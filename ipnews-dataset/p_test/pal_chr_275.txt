 In spite of an April court ruling against any activity of the kind, the works on constructing the wall in the Cremisan valley, located near Bethlehem, started on Monday. The construction is a section of a wall Israel started building in 2002 citing security concerns. To clear and dig the ground for a wire fence and a cement wall, olive trees have already been rooted out with bulldozers. According to initial plans , the Cremisan valley part of the wall was to run through the land owned by nearly 60 Christian Palestinian families, and was to separate a Roman Catholic monastery from its sister convent and school. The wall is set to divide the West Bank city of Beit Jala from the settlement of Har Gilo and the village of Walaja. The construction of the wall has been opposed by Palestinians, as well as local Christian leaders and the Vatican. They say it could encourage Israeli settlement expansion, leading to the annexation of Palestinian land, while cutting people off their land lots. In April, Israel’s high court urged the defense ministry to reconsider the route of the wall, and the ministry reacted with a letter to a landowners’ lawyer promising to exclude the monasteries from the plan. Last month a subsequent ruling permitted to go ahead with the wall, with slight changes to the plan for areas around buildings. Nasser said that citizens still have the right to appeal again to the Supreme Court, and they are set to use it, urging to consider the concerns of all parties.
